ending up creating an over-hype in public. It is reinforced by so many factors such as the difficult-to-research and dynamic nature of neuroscience, publication biases, journalistic issues (limitations, lack of knowledge, fallacies etc.). On top of these issues, there are journalistic issues that require to fit such a complex topic into certain time frames with particular concerns. Combined with the complexity and public perception on neuroscience, having an excitement bubble around the field is inevitable, considering that there is a general hype trend around science in general (Jamieson, Kahan, Scheufele, 2017). However, we can at least mitigate the adverse effects of the neuro hype by pushing the consumers and producers of popular news media content about neuroscience to be more knowledgeable and critical about the content they are dealing with. Thus, harnessing the power of Science of Learning (Kosslyn, 2016) and Cialdini’s persuasion principles (1984), NeuroJourno aims to educate primarily journalists, secondarily students and thirdly general public to mitigate the neuro hype. While there are certainly challenges, by understanding the problem we are dealing with, and breaking the causes down, we might be mitigating the problem in the long term.","Journalism, Neurohype, Website, Tip-sheet","Journalism, Interactive NeuroScience Website","From Journalism tutorial #critique, #evidencebased, #sourcequality

This has brought about many conversations on education reform, LGBTQ+ rights, and other social issues that have not been delved into as much due to Thailand’s conservative values. But now that old values are being dismantled and being critically examined, liberal ideas are being shared by the younger generation. This includes the topic of gender equality and feminism, however, shared critical knowledge on sexism and the way it manifests itself in Thai culture is not as made aware in the larger public.
The topic of feminism and women’s rights in Thailand often revolves around the topic of prostitution and sex trafficking, which is a consistent human rights issue in Thailand. However, because feminist ideas contradict Thai traditional values ie. the idea of the ‘Ideal Woman’ in being ‘The Flower of the Nation’ (the best thing for a woman to be is beautiful, humble, and neat) persists and is left unexamined. While legally, women are equal to men, socially they are not treated as such. Supported by Thai traditional values due to its rigid hierarchies and existing institutions (ie. Thailand being a Buddhist country, women are forbidden to have any physical contact with monks as they are seen as ‘dirty’ and ‘sinful’ in nature, women are also regarded as inherently inferior and would have a hard time reaching nirvana than men). 
Inspired by how spoken word was a vehicle for feminism and the way that artists can transform political thoughts by making ‘the personal political’, I want to participate in my country’s political conversation through expressive arts. With this capstone, I aim to create an experimental art film, presenting prop pieces that I fabricated, called ‘I Don’t Feel at Home in My Body: Objects of Oppression’ to call out toxic sexist norms in Thai culture that induce a sense of discomfort in the audience with these norms. The end product is a short experimental film and a write-up to analyze my pieces.
This will allow me to apply the Learning Outcomes from my Arts & Humanities major by going through a complete process of art-making, from conducting background research, doing preliminary sketches and building prototypes as well as creating a preliminary presentation. It will allow me to combine what I studied in art analysis, theories on art-making, and the creation of protest art that critically engage with social themes. I want to pursue this project rather than the one previously proposed because I want to do a piece that was more socially-relevant and is more concept-driven rather than medium driven. Additionally, this will also help me grow as an artist by venturing outside of my usual medium (painting).",,"Creative (e.g., writing, art)","#ah166protestart, #ah166produceart #ah166expressart #ah166contextualizeart #ah156multimedianalysis #ah156ideasandbeliefs #ah146bodytheories #ah146artessay #ah146contentandform",,"Polymer clay sculpture, using Skillshare and attending local art classes in Bangkok.

The role of film as entertainment makes it a particularly powerful medium to shape culture. My main goal is to understand how film aesthetics can be manipulated to spread hate. Extensive research has been done and published on the topic of Nazi propaganda and the particular role of film; I add to that by conducting an in-depth case-study on Jud Süss (1940) and comparing it to its earlier British version, Jew Süss (1934) to trace how it became such a prominent expression of antisemitism. By mapping out the ways in which antisemitism is made present in Jud Suss, I build on Friedlander’s assertion that Jud Süss (1940) is a direct response to Jew Süss (1934).

In 2006 ACUMAR was founded to be the institution in charge of the river for the and by the community and achieve the goal of becoming an entity of ""environmental reparations"". However, even after 15 years of the creation of ACUMAR, the river is still polluted, and the goals of sustainability, were not fully reached

In this paper, I will first bring into focus the prior historical conditions of the social grassroot, self-organized neighbor movements that led to the legal case, 20 years after, relating to the socio-environmental issues of the river. I will bring the the subsequent legal process of ratification that happened during 2004-2008, focusing on the narrative differences between grassroots movements and institutions (governments, law, etc). My goal in this paper is to lead the reader to understand the importance of grassroots mobilizations in the context of climate crisis. This project allows the reader to understand that institutional governmental and corporative terms, times and interests most often, do not vouch completely for the interest of citizens and the health of the environment, nor have the absolut solutions to solve the climate crisis, in fact, nobody does. Since the world finds itself in a current climate crisis that, my goal in this paper is to inform and also become a call for action. The story of the neighborhood organizations around the Matanza river shows how successful can be to lead pacifist and legitimate rebelty around socio-environmental issues. However, institutional times are difficult and, irremediably leading us to a socio-environmental collapse. Therefore, ""solutions"" are not found in top-down organizations, but in learning to collectively make bottom-up narratives and claims become topics of conversations, education and community action.","grassroot movements, climate crisis, climate collapse, environmentalism, socio-environmental issues, Matanza-Riachuelo River Basin, Argentina, ACUMAR","Primary research (e.g., with a research group), Historical research",#ConnectionInContext #Historiography #Worldviews #GlobalEnvironments #GlobalScienceAndTech,"#activism: analyses the impact of intellectual/academic knowledge bridging territorial/local/bottom-up activism

The project has two parts: a paper outlining the scholarly influences and a digital platform where I exhibit the findings and make them publicly accessible in both Ukrainian and English.
In the paper, I examine the challenges that feminist thinking and increasing digitization of historical sources bring into the processes of writing the history. The work translates these global processes into the local context of modernization through a women's history. I argue that one cannot understand the history of Ukraine without addressing the blank spots where the history of Ukrainian women ought to be. In my digital exhibit I focus on the stories of selected young Ukrainian females on the verge of the 20th century, who were among the first ones in the country to get educated, in order to bring to life my argument that their stories are needed to rethink the existing historical narratives.","digital humanities, digital exhibit, feminist theory in history, historical silences, public education","Creative (e.g., writing, art), Educational curriculum/materials, Digital platform for general education in history and culture","#ah162historicalsilences, #ss156agentsandoutcomes, #ah162publichistory, #ss156ideasandsociety, #ah162historicalframing, #ah142primarysources","Based off tutorials:

The 5-episode project on India's history will cover topics ranging from religious conflicts, national narratives, absence of women in history, historical research to personal and collective memories. Supported by interviews with historians, friends, and family, the episodes will also document how research about the past shapes people's present.

This leads to the question of whether these aspects affect students’ mental health in unique ways. Given Minerva’s unique model, whether student mental wellbeing can be maintained is vital to the model’s ethical standing. Section 1 of this analytical paper describes Minerva’s unique model. Section 2 discusses whether and to what extent universities are morally responsible for supporting student mental health, arguing universities have both a normative and prudential obligation to facilitate student mental thriving. Section 3 analyzes these obligations in the specific context of Minerva, considering whether its purpose affects its ethical responsibilities, concluding Minerva has this obligation to an even larger extent. Given these findings, Section 4 discusses mental health literature to confirm that Minerva can, in principle, meet these obligations. Section 5 uses Minerva-specific data to evaluate where Minerva currently does and does not meet its obligations in practice. An accompanying policy proposal suggests empirically-based interventions to make Minerva's model more ethical in practice, given the findings of the previous sections.

The toxic, competitive environment of social media is largely due to this growing need for social validation amongst its young users. The most common metric for this social validation is the number of likes, followers, and reaffirming comments that these users seek. However, very few are actually able to gather this sense of approval and validation – leading the rest to doubt their self-worth and become trapped in a pit of depression and anxiety. Therefore, the overarching goal for this capstone is to negate the negative competitive spirit of existing social media platforms and turn it into a healthy one by leveraging collaboration, peer-learning and accountability. More specifically, I am proposing an online platform is for teenagers who are a victim of these grave issues where they can join communities of like-minded people and pursue their passions by learning skills from each other. They will also receive external mentorship opportunities to stay on track. The capstone will analyze and validate this problem through secondary research, propose a business plan for the proposed platform, and supplement it with a web mockup.","Digital Community, Mental Health, Peer-learning, Collaboration, Product Design, Business Plan, Productivity, Consumer Psychology, Impact-driven Startup","Business plan, App","#b110researchStrategy, #b110customercentricity, #b144inspiration #cs162agile, #cs162communication",,"Social entrepreneurship, product development, product design, product management, consumer research, data analysis, UX/UI, innovation, web development",,,N/A (no project involves interacting with any people and/or their data),Eberhardt

As Gartner (2019) predicts, ""By 2022, 10% of personal devices will have emotion AI capabilities."" Emotion AI will be the next phase of technology development in which companies can integrate emotional understanding and consciousness into AI and humanize this technology for the good of humanity. The industry is projected to grow at USD 25 billion by 2023, with a CAGR of 17% (2017 - 2023) (Market Research Future, n.d). However, despite this technology's potential, there are still many discussions raising psychological, technical, and ethical concerns about the limitations and feasibility of building such a platform to detect emotions. 

Crawfold (2019) argues that this field was built on ""markedly shaky foundations,"" meaning no scientific consensus on emotion detections. In this paper, I say that this scientific dissensus is the core constraint of this industry, leading to technical and commercial problems. I used the word ""constraint"" instead of ""obstacle"" because I believe this problem is not something businesses can overcome easily, nor can scientists figure it out in a short period. The scientific dissensus negatively influences all steps in the process of developing the Emotion AI model: including input choices, data acquisition, data preparation, feature engineering, model training, model deployment, and output display. It also leads to challenges to regulate this field and raises issues about usefulness, data protection, and ethics. These issues reduce the public adoption and acceptance of Emotion AI applications, affecting revenue generation of businesses working in this field.

Therefore, this project aims to explain these core challenges and develop strategies to overcome or work around them. In the first part of the paper, I will discuss how the core constraint - the lack of scientific consensus - happens and influences both the product development and the commercialization process of an Emotion AI application. The second part of the paper aims to provide directions that a business can follow in dealing with this industry's uncertainty. Although these directions may only help companies to deal with these problems at a macro level, they could be a starting point for developing sustainable strategies to support businesses in the long term.

Entrepreneurship is also a major contributor to job creation, poverty reduction, narrowing inequality gaps, and gender equality (Criscuolo et al, 2014, Adenutsi, 2009). The participation of women in entrepreneurship across most developed and developing countries has increased significantly in recent years, and yet, the female participation rate in entrepreneurship is systematically lower than male participation rates (Cardella et al, 2020). Furthermore, gender gaps in entrepreneurship exist not only in participation, but also financing, attitudes, access to resources and networks. This phenomenon is problematic for two main reasons -- from a normative standpoint and in accordance with feminist theory, there should be theoretical and practical equality of opportunity, and from an economic perspective, increasing women’s participation and success in the entrepreneurial realm has a significant potential for greater economic returns (Teasdale, 2011), (Cardella et al, 2020). 
This project focuses on Bulgaria’s female entrepreneurship as a case in point. Bulgaria is a country plagued by major societal issues -- gender inequalities and underdevelopment being prominent ones, while at the same time it exhibits great potential for entrepreneurial activity. The project reviews literature on women’s entrepreneurship research, relevant literature on the current entrepreneurial environment in Bulgaria as well as challenges faced by Bulgarian female entrepreneurs. The problem is analyzed from a Wicked Problem and Systems Thinking perspectives. The Wicked Problem framework is further applied to design a proposal for a community of women entrepreneurs aimed at narrowing the gender gap in entrepreneurship in Bulgaria.

The goal is to provide convenient educational content to Gen Z users online with the hopes of equipping them with the tools needed to develop skills and knowledge that can improve their mental and social wellbeing. This project dwells into Gen Z’s needs more deeply, explores how online teaching can be done most effectively, and creates an exemplary product in which this kind of self-improvement related content can be made accessible.

While there has been research around prize design in the public sector especially around development or technical challenges, the literature around using prize design strategically within business contexts has been limited. 

To bridge this gap, this practical guidebook proposes the concept of prize architecture, defined as a complex process of combining design elements and design decisions to achieve pre-specified objectives. Building upon existing literature, this guide outlines an actionable framework which offers nine elements for prize architects, specifically within SMEs, to achieve business objectives. The second section details the author’s process of designing and executing a prize challenge for EdTechX—  a London-based edtech events company. This serves as a proof of concept for the framework through the lens of accelerating innovation in the education industry and ultimately advancing EdTechX’s mission to connect the global learning community.

Using a sports organization called Community Sports Pioneer in Pakistan, we evaluate the organization's internal and external factors to see the organization's current situation and its athletes and how we plan to improve it over the year. Lastly, it provides a business proposal keeping in mind the improvements that could be made with Community Sports Pioneer to enhance athletes' performance in mind, proposing ideas regarding the implementation of the proposal and metrics to measure the success.

Primary and secondary research will be utilized to comprise existing research done by researchers on how organizations impact athletes' performance, surveys, and interviews conducted within the organization by ourselves and then using that research for the brand revamp, present in the business proposal.

Recently, more attention has been drawn to the exploitation present in Thailand’s fishing industry. Although the government has enacted many policies aimed at combating human trafficking, the industry still thrives. Therefore, there is a growing need for social-impact driven businesses to support government initiatives. This raises the question, ‘How can businesses leverage their resources and capabilities to combat human trafficking in a way that creates shared value?’ I argue that the answer lies in Strategic Corporate Social Responsibility, where social responsibility becomes embedded in businesses’ core functions. Through this paper, I aim to create a thorough strategic CSR proposal for multinational corporations to combat human trafficking in Thailand. First, I describe the evolution of the concept of CSR and synthesize four theories into one framework to gain a holistic understanding of CSR. The synthesized framework asks corporations to evaluate it’s supply chains effects, understand the impact of the competitive context, identify stakeholder interests, and design strategic CSR initiatives that create shared value for the firm and society. I follow with an overview of the available but limited data on trafficking in Thailand. Then, I will apply the synthesized CSR framework to the fishing industry in Thailand. Lastly, in response to the potential challenges raised by applying this framework, I discuss addressing supply chain complexity through continuous data collection and analysis, leveraging firms’ internal capabilities to center CSR initiatives, and seeking out the expertise of relevant stakeholders through multi-stakeholder collaborations and partnerships.

Gender imbalance in public events is complex and nuanced — it is likely rooted in gender inequality, and at the same time, it preserves the status quo. This project stands with the idea that diverse and inclusive voices in public conversations are essential to how the broader community produces and consumes knowledge. This capstone unpacks the manels phenomenon by looking at how it ties to gender inequality; the interplays of manel, gender stereotypes, and bias; and how they manifest on different levels of analysis. Finally, we explore how bringing women-identifying individuals to the public sphere can bring more equality. We propose the Inclusive Spotlight–––a platform where women can showcase their expertise, connect with other women, and discover speaking opportunities. We aim to bring female leaders to event organizers' attention, enabling them to ensure diverse and inclusive spaces.","Gender equality, representation and inclusion, gender bias & stereotypes, conferences","Analysis/synthesis of existing works (possibly with proposal for future work), Business plan, App","#B110whyExist, #SS111-constructivism

Delving into the literature space surrounding digital workplaces of the past decade or so, the author highlights issues with its scope of topic exploration. In order to be more specific and avoid problems rooting from the diversity of business characteristics while implementing digital workplaces, the author proposes an approach of investigating specific relevant challenges and respective risks, benefits, and solution levers. In order to do so, changes in the workforce and the global COVID-19 pandemic have been identified as major drivers of digital workplace urgency to build the challenges around. Challenges found include cultural and demographic unification, digital behaviors, lack of implementation time, and work-life balance. The author urgently calls for more research on the challenges and how they should be addressed to provide businesses with timely responses to the current world context.","office,digital workspace,digital office,management,optimization,value,productivity,qualitative,presentation,recommendation","Analysis/synthesis of existing works (possibly with proposal for future work), Business plan","#b111bizrisk,#b112socioCulturalStrat",,"Organizational design

Of those in prison, about 41% haven’t been formally charged for a crime at all, and the average time before they are processed and receive a trial is six and a half years. Of those who are unjustly incarcerated, a large proportion is businessmen whose companies or operations in some way oppose the state or the monopolies’ private goals. It is hypothesized that these inefficiencies in the criminal process are due to corruption and the tight relationship between the government and legislative agencies. Thus, this paper evaluates the potential effects of corruption and fear of unjustified incarceration on entrepreneurship and economic development through a series of interviews with businessmen, lawyers, workers of the judicial system, and political prisoners. A literature review is presented based on secondary public data regarding corruption and entrepreneurship indices in Guatemala and publicly available sources regarding media coverage of the aforementioned issues to supplement the interviews. A lack of primary peer-reviewed sources about the criminal justice system and its relationship with governmental agencies is revealed as well as an overall lack of mention of the role of monopolies and the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) on the corruption of the judicial system in Guatemala.","Corruption, Criminal Justice System, Entrepreneurship, Economic Development, Legislation, Government Branch, Policy, Media, Politics, Economic Growth, Business Expansion, Guatemala, Penitentiary System, Prisons, Incarceration.","Analysis/synthesis of existing works (possibly with proposal for future work), Primary research (e.g., with a research group)","#SS111economicindicators, #SS164economicgrowthordevelopment, #SS164institutions, #SS164conflictorcorruption, #SS164economicinfluences, #SS164economicimpact, #AH111authoritylegitimacy, #AH111justice, #SS112institutionaldecay, #SS156roleoforganizations, #SS156formalrules, #SS156informalrules, #B112polistrat, #B112socioculturalstrat, #B112econstrat, #B145enCulture, #B154growthTradeoffs",,"I will use the knowledge I have gained from my business major, specifically regarding the bidirectional relationship between business and the socio-cultural environment.

In fact, customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) is up across the board for both B2B and B2C companies, and has increased by nearly 50% over the past five years (Campbell, n.a.). Knowing this, it is natural to assume that companies are trying to find alternative ways to acquire customers than costly or ineffective measures of ad targeting and email campaigns.

Overall, its agricultural sector (only including unprocessed crops) is important, representing 9% of the national GDP. On the other hand, soy companies have low margins for multiple reasons, including high taxes, lack of public infrastructure and private investment, and an unstable economy with high inflation. In order to tackle these obstacles, there have been both public and private proposals. Some of these have been successful, while some have remained purely theoretical. There have been few and scattered attempts at optimizing Argentine agricultural supply chains via digital transformations, none of which have gained national or, even, provincial traction. This paper proposes a model based on Google Sheets using the Solver add-on to increase profit margins that leverages the benefits of digitization and data. The proposed model is most likely to be useful for larger companies that have access or the capability to obtain large quantities of data.

The Technical perspective consists of stock price prediction models which feed into a Portfolio Optimization tool, based on Markowitz's theory. The final product is an interactive website.
The Fundamental perspective consists of a financial model and a research report as an example of how to research a company for investment.

While Basel III was already launched back in 2015, many banks in Vietnam are still struggling with Basel II. As of 2020, only 13 out of 99 banks in Vietnam successfully complied with Basel II (Vu, 2019). One major challenge banks in Vietnam are facing is the internal ratings-based (IRB) approach suggested in Basel II, which requests internal estimation for risk elements and the capital needed to absorb the credit risk exposure. A common solution to this requirement is the adoption of machine learning (ML) applications in credit rating activities, which many banks in Vietnam do not have enough technical knowledge and experience with.
To address this issue, the paper will provide a step-by-step introduction to develop ML credit rating models with a self-developed logistic regression model as an illustration. The framework is expected to bring Vietnam’s banks closer to the successful adoption of the IRB approach.","Internal ratings-approach, credit rating, basel, machine learning, logistic regression, banks","Educational curriculum/materials, Data analysis","#CS156Overfitting, #CS156modelmetrics, #CS166PythonImplementation, #B155Organicgrowth, B111Bizrisk",,"Modeling, data analysis, regression, business plan",,,N/A (no project involves interacting with any people and/or their data),Mathur

Fama proved his model works by applying different statistical and event-based tests on each form of the hypothesis and concluded that the US market is more efficient than not (Fama, 1970). Since 1970, an increasing amount of replication studies for each form of the hypothesis have been published, and new tests were formed (Lim & Brooks, 2006; Ţiţan, 2015). Most of the replication studies applied on the same markets have contradictory conclusions about these markets’ efficiencies in the weak and semi-strong forms. This paper provided examples from the literature that show such inconsistencies for the first two forms of the hypothesis.  An empirical analysis is also conducted with various statistical tests on the weak form of financial market efficiency using the historical time series data of stock prices of 42 software companies listed on the NASDAQ index. The paper concluded by showing that the Efficient Market Hypothesis does not hold all the time and introduces the Adaptive Market Hypothesis proposed by Lo (2004) as the first step to a universal hypothesis that adapts to the cyclical nature of the financial markets between efficiency and inefficiency periods (Lo, 2004).

Thus, it is important for both the government and for fintech businesses to assess the value digital payment brings to the economy and to review the progress of the country’s transition towards a cashless economy to identify gaps in consumer behavior, policies, technology, and financial inclusion to fulfill. This paper addresses the research question of  “Should Vietnam transition into a digital payment dominant economy and what can the Vietnamese government and fintech businesses do to achieve that?”
	This project is a comprehensive market research that links published data to qualitative research on Vietnam’s digitization of business-to-customer (B2C) transactions. It analyses the economic and financial rationale that justifies the transition towards digital payment of the Vietnamese market and assesses the gap in what has been done by the government and fintech businesses.

Most of these transactions happen through multi-sided platforms. MSPs are created when a company (new or existing) adopts a ""platform strategy"". Traditional business models create value ""chains"" or ""pipelines"" with suppliers at one end, the company in the middle, and customers at the other end. Value (and price) rises linearly as the product in question moves along the chain or pipeline. In contrast, platform strategies create and distribute value nonlinearly through networks with different classes of affiliated customers (Haigu & Wright, 2011). 
The activities and interactions that happen through MSPs are progressively more diverse (Parker et al., 2016). They now include industries like housing (e.g. Airbnb), transportation (e.g. Uber), food (e.g. Grubhub), entertainment (e.g. Steam), tourism (e.g. TripAdvisor), amongst others.

While we use the term MSPs throughout the analysis, we refer more specifically to digital MSPs. In the broadest sense, malls, credit card networks and phone companies can be considered multi-sided platforms. Still, this analysis's focus is mainly digital Multi-Sided Platforms facilitating interactions amongst agents from different ""groups"" through some form of an online platform. Notice also that referring to these groups as ""buyers"" and ""sellers"" is done to facilitate comparison across MSPs based on the direction of payment (buyer → seller); for example, neither potential employees nor potential employers on LinkedIn ""buy"" anything from each other, but we refer to employers as buyers and employees as sellers because the direction of payment is most often employer → employee. 
 MSPs are in the process of transforming our business landscape, economy and society because they employ strategies that enable non-linear value creation as opposed to traditional businesses linear or semi-linear value creation schemes. Socially, MSPs can allow otherwise mistrusting agents to trust each other.  As businesses, MSPs can give significant value to their shareholders, users (of all kinds), and communities. Economically, MSPs can make markets more efficient.
This paper is an exploration of the strategies MSPs use to enable non-linear value creation through a business, financial, and economic perspective. It is also a case study on MSP design. Kadi Clubs, a nascent MSP founded and run by the author in conjunction with Luis Gonzalez, is an MSP that connects sports players and sports venues. After discussing each MSP strategy, we will contextualize its application (or intentional lack of) to the case of Kadi Clubs. This case study approach gives us some insight into the first-hand perspective of an MSP.

The planet has seen a cumulative loss of $470 billion due to natural catastrophes in the past 2 years (CFLI, 2019). Seeing as most of the capital in the world is commanded by corporations, the private sector is indispensable for a transition to a more sustainable planet (Porter, 2020). The world has come from $30billion worth of government pledges for climate finance in 2012 to over a $100billion in 2020 but it is still not nearly enough to keep temperatures under 1.5C degrees (UNDP, 2011).
With this increased level of money being directed towards climate change come opportunities to unlock investment from the private sector using public finance. To catalyze this transition, blended finance can play a crucial role especially in developing countries where the risk-return profile of early-stage climate techs startups remains unfavorable to the private sector due to a myriad of barriers and gaps (Convergence, 2020). My deliverable for this project is a guidebook for how national level policy makers from governments around the world can leverage PPP Startup Accelerators to catalyze early-stage climate tech innovation. I have developed the first draft of this guidebook by carefully analyzing the state of climate tech acceleration, the climate tech entrepreneurial ecosystem, challenges, key barriers, and gaps. Towards the end of my paper, I have provided a comprehensive set of recommendations on how to overcome some of the barriers presented. I have provided these recommendations in a way that encourages national policy makers to engage stakeholders from both the public and private sector.

This valuation task is made even more abstract when the value of tech companies increasingly lies in their ""soft"" assets (i.e. , employees' talents), which traditional accounting does not properly account for. 

As China's relevance in the global market increases, I will attempt to address the challenges above by writing an equity report for China's second largest but less covered tech company - Tencent. Tencent, the company that created and was originally known for WeChat, has expanded into gaming, fintech and business services (to name a few).

Widely-published equity reports on Tencent often assume that the reader has a basic understanding of who Tencent is. This information gap has disenfranchised readers without a prior understanding of Tencent. Hence, my final deliverable will be foremost an equity report on Tencent with sum-of-the-parts valuation of Tencent's three distinct business segments and an aggregate company valuation.

Evidence from CDP data and S&P 500,"As climate change poses physical and transitional risks to companies' financial performance, investors are seeking ways to integrate firm-specific climate change risk into their investment analysis. Consequently, to accommodate investors' demands, companies have increased their voluntary disclosure levels on climate change. However, it is not entirely clear whether these disclosures are linked to the investor's perceived risk of the company.
Using financial data from S&P 500 companies and Climate Disclosure Project (CDP) data for 2019, I employ ordinary least square regression to explore the association between the firm-level cost of equity and (1) whether the company discloses to CDP and (2) what rating it receives from CDP regarding its climate change performance. I find a statistically non-significant relationship between these variables. Furthermore, I find that the sector trend where non-disclosers tend to have a lower cost of equity than disclosers disappears when controlling for company size. This paper contributes towards the literature documenting the link between the cost of equity and voluntary climate change disclosure by employing previously unconsidered datasets.

One solution to the stagnation of innovation and growth in legacy financial systems promises to be the in the form of Decentralized Finance (DeFi hereafter), an umbrella term for financial applications that utilize blockchain technology to solve problems that exist within the traditional financial system. By behaving as the open-source 'Internet of Money', DeFi is posited to emerge as the third generation of internet infrastructure (Web 3.0) building a robust financial system from the ground-up operating independently from centralized financial intermediaries like banks, credit unions, or insurance funds.

This paper analytically explores how DeFi is emerging as a nascent digital asset class seeking to disrupt several legacy financial processes and contrasts DeFi to the centralized framework of traditional financial markets. Through case-studies of decentralized financial derivatives, network analogies of growth, heuristic models of valuation, and community-driven research, this paper presents novel insights and regulatory proposals into making a case that trustless decentralized systems of financial infrastructure can truly give people access to new financial opportunities, wherever they live, with more control of their assets.","Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Game Theory, Stablecoins, Prediction Markets, Venture Capital/M&A, Cryptocurrency, Blockchain, Valuation, Fintech, Automated Market Makers, Brand Strategy, Competitive Landscape Analysis","Educational curriculum/materials, Analysis/synthesis of existing works (possibly with proposal for future work), Business plan","#b165currency, #b146competitiveAdvantage, #b165forwardLooking, #ss164institutions, #b145vcInvestors, #b112howGlobal, #b112econStrat, #b112globalSegmentation",,"Deal Sourcing (Market Landscape Research), Financial Modeling & Forecasting, Academic Writing, Growth-Hacking, Public Policy & Regulatory Research",,,N/A (no project involves interacting with any people and/or their data),Mathur

Businesses, schools, and almost every other public space were suddenly empty. Among these public places were museums. In the United Kingdom, most museums were closed for around five months, before being allowed to reopen with extra care. The shutdown, with its economic and mobility consequences, raised concerns about museums’ ability to remain financially capable of fulfilling their socio-educational role.

This paper tries to quantify the financial impact suffered by the Victoria & Albert Museum, in London, by looking at pre-COVID trends in the museums’ financial reports and analyzing how the pandemic changes forecasts for the future.

These bonds focus on changing the focus from inputs to outputs or outcomes in impact investments, aligning incentives across the key stakeholders, and improving collaboration amongst the ecosystem in areas such as data handling and infrastructural support for future impact bonds. I analyze the model to discuss the value created for each stakeholder, break down the various forms of payment structures, and provide an overview of the current state of impact bonds.

Mainly, the need to have internet coverage whenever they go to different countries. Some people face this problem more than others, based on their traveling frequency, such as Minervans, where the college program depends on global education, where students spend each semester in a different country. Accordingly, in such cases, people face the problem of having SIM card plans in each country they go to, and even that does not solve the problem, because they need at least one day to navigate to get these SIM cards. So, how can travelers experience get better? Here is when SIM-Mi comes to action. 

Such a problem is an eye-opener to how telecommunication evolved over the decades to accomodate how the world operates. Starting with the idea of roaming, and how a certain carrier data can be used in outside-of-country activities and travels. An example of a futuristic visionary project will be SIM-Mi. SIM-Mi will be the local helping hand for travelers, as it will be an application that will function like a SIM card for a predetermined amount of time. Users will pay by card, and the application will be partnered with sim-card carrier companies in multiple regions that provide their services to the users once they land in the designated airport. Such an idea is better than having a Google fi plan because sometimes people are not always traveling. So, a plan that’s more convenient and efficient will be more helpful. 
For the capstone final paper, the intended deliverables are a research paper showing how globalization affected and is affecting the telecommunication industry, plus a prototype for the SIM-Mi web application and a devised business framework.

However, conventional DCF valuation was created for mature stable companies that yield stable growth and returns, with long standing financial history and data.

However, few self learners can really sit through college lecture videos which commonly run for two to three hours. In fact, 90% of MOOCs students drop out quickly after 2-week enrollment. Although lecture videos are great for knowledge dissemination, its heavy length and lack of interactivity often stifles “Active Learning”, the power engine of one’s life-long intellectual growth.
With a vision to make the MOOCs experience much more ‘active’ for the benefits of self-learners, my project aims to turn passive video ‘watching’ into active video ‘reading’ by interacting with features 'with-IN' the video frame. First, the project will explore various machine-learning algorithms on automatic video content extraction & learning; then apply learning results to build a web interface with features like: 
      1) a caption-based keyword search engine to find contents within a video; 
      2) a floating  ‘explorer’ to search external multimedia resources (like wikipedia or tutorials) while streaming the lecture video; 
      3) editing tool to create intra-video hyperlinks for nonlinear content navigation; 
The final product is a working web app running on Flask virtual server that accepts a youtube video link and displays all three interactive learning features outlined above.

Dialect Identification is the first major stepping stone to advance NLP tools for Arabic dialects (Salameh et al., 2018). Improvement in automatic dialect Identification means translates into knowledge of the input Arabic text for other NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis and machine translation, which often increases the performance of the model (Salameh et al., 2018). Additionally, a good approach to dialect identification for Arabic dialects requires building robust datasets, a clear understanding of the differences between the dialects and how to best account for spelling and pronunciation differences, all of which will positively contribute to other NLP advances in the field.

Online asynchronous learning is a prominent avenue for such learning due to its accessibility. There is a huge wealth of free learning resources online, powered by a combination of traditional education institutions making their resources available and informal passionate educators sharing their own knowledge.

 However, these resources live on different websites and are independent from each other. This is a problem because learning depends not only on consuming information, but on consuming the ways that they are related to each other into mental models that can be remembered and recalled as appropriate. Additionally, there is a lack of support for customisation, as resources are either purely standalone content or rigid sequences similar to traditional academic courses.

This project is an attempt at building on the potential of the wealth of resources and the population of informal online educators to organize learning resources in a way that emphasises relationships and supports metacognition for more efficient self-directed learning in adults.","Edtech

Around the world, producers and songwriters are continuously on the look-out for new inspiration, be it from chord progressions, arpeggios, vocal samples, or something as common as a clap. Samples are crucial to most producers’ careers because equipment like instruments, microphones, and drums are either too expensive or too big for most people. Whatever the genre, samples are at the core of inspiration and creation, uniqueness and quality being two of the most characteristics of these samples (Future Music, 2017). To approach this problem and market, I will design and develop a web application to distribute audio samples to the global producer community. I will provide data-driven, pre-screened samples ready for download and track placement meant to inspire and improve workflow for producers of all levels and genres.","Music, web development, audio recording, audio engineering, UI, algorithms","Creative (e.g., writing, art), App","#cs162abstraction

However, caused by the diversity of programming tools and environment setups within the student group, grading these code-based assignments is an inefficient and time-consuming process. An Autograder system is a service which standardizes the input format and automatically runs the compiled code through a custom set of hidden test cases to give an overall assessment of the correctness, run-time, and formatting of a submitted piece of code. The Autograder system could significantly reduce the grading time for professors and provide instant feedback to students. To build an accessible and stable system, I need to construct an intelligent backend which securely runs each submission within an isolated sandbox while optimizing for the run-time distribution.

However, another way to promote their goals is preventing cared-for animals from entering the shelter, shifting the focus to intake data. Improving Return-to-Owner (RTO) rates of stray dogs is one path to save significant shelter space, time, and costs and keep animals with their caregivers and communities. Aggregating and visualizing RTO data spatially is useful for identifying trends and highlighting areas for potential interventions. Since shelters collect similar data, an interactive web application was developed to make such an analysis easily reproducible. This paper presents the tool’s capabilities via a case-study of 2019 data from the Dallas Animal Services shelter, covering the relationship between stray intake and RTO rate, the distances traveled from home by RTOed strays, microchip use across the city and its relationship with RTO rate, the length of stay of RTOs compared to other outcomes, and the areas into which non-RTO strays are leaving for adoption or foster. Findings include showing that 70% of RTOed strays traveled at most one mile away from home and 42% up to block away, that at-large, adult strays which had a microchip had a 71% RTO rate compared to 39% without one, and that length of stay for RTOed dogs was uniform for owners across the city. The results affected the shelter’s hold time for strays, highlighted target areas for microchip programs, and motivated neighborhood-based methods to locate found dogs' owners. Shelters are welcome to use the tool and participate in the development of new analytical lenses and visualizations that would best suit their needs.

The website focuses on swing trading - a popular short-to-medium-term stock trading strategy that is generally riskier than investing. The first section, Basic concept, provides definitions of the financial market, stock trading, swing trading, technical analysis, and fundamental analysis. The second section introduces three main types of swing trading techniques: chart-based, momentum, and mean reversion. The third section outlines basic risk mitigation techniques: placing the right order, using the Modern Portfolio to reduce diversifiable risks, and using CAPM to determine the minimum required return that offsets non-diversifiable risks. The fourth section briefly introduces four simple stock price prediction techniques and their shortcomings: ARIMA, Prophet, Random Forest, and SVM. Future work includes adding interactive activities and mini-article summaries, fine-tuning the portfolio optimization code parameters, and bringing the website closer to its target audience.

However, most college textbooks and most research papers have a reading level that is much higher than 12th grade (Chavkin, 1997; Plavén-Sigray, Matheson, Schiffler & Thompson, 2016). This reading level gap can cause a user’s working memory to bypass their cognitive load, making a text hard to understand (e.g., Peng et al., 2018; Caretti, Borella, Cornoldi & De Beni, 2009). Oftentimes, users don’t make adequate decisions to alleviate the cognitive load (e.g., Goldman & Pellegrino, 2015; Cuevas & Dawson, 2017).

While generative models attempt to accelerate drug discovery by sampling de novo lead-like molecules directly, these models do not predict off-target effects or efficacy on the target's genetic variants and thus require extensive in vivo screens. Therefore, we developed tinymolecule, a Python package to prioritize drug candidates for preclinical wet lab evaluations. It incorporates high-throughput molecular docking and binding affinity ranking of small molecules sampled from generative models.

In this work, we generated thousands of molecules with a variational autoencoder and applied tinymolecule to find molecules inhibiting C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5), a target implicated in breast cancer metastasis. We selected five candidate small molecules that, compared to clinical drugs like maraviroc and vicriviroc, exhibited higher binding affinity on CCR5 variants and lower binding affinity on off-target receptors. Additionally, our side-chain interactions analysis found no overlap of binding motifs between on-targets and off-targets, potentially indicating selected molecules' high specificity.

One such inefficiency is the unplanned hospitalization prevalent in many healthcare systems, incurring disproportionate financial burden for the administration and adverse health outcomes for the patients. With a highly predictive model, hospitalization risk scores can be generated, enabling healthcare systems to more efficiently allocate their resources to reduce cost and improve patient care. Previous attempts have mainly used logistic regression to model hospitalization, which led to subpar predictive power. State-of-the-art methods, such as random forest or neural networks have yet been explored in this topic. In my capstone, I will be using a dataset of electronic health records (EHR) from SF Health Network, with 164,803 observations from 2002-2018, to model unplanned hospitalization among patients with kidney conditions.

In this paper, I try to take a step further and evaluate whether deep learning algorithms can distinguish among different subtypes belonging to the same type of mutation (EGFR mutation) in lung cancer from a small dataset obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas. I trained a convolutional neural network (Inception v3) on tiled whole slide images to predict the three classes of EGFR mutation subtypes - exon 19 mutants, exon 21 mutants, and other subtypes. The per-tile AUC of binary classifications between each two of the classes are 0.606, 0.629, and 0.739, suggesting that deep learning might have the potential to perform mutation subtype classifications.

This paper extends the literature on the theoretical properties of synthetic controls to the case of non-linear generative models, showing that the synthetic control estimator is generally biased in such settings. I derive a lower bound for the bias, showing that the only component of it that is affected by the choice of synthetic control is the weighted sum of pairwise differences between the treated unit and the untreated units in the synthetic control. To address this bias, I propose a synthetic control estimator which allows for a constant difference of the synthetic control to the treated unit in the pre-treatment period, and which penalizes the pairwise discrepancies. Allowing for a constant offset makes the model more flexible, thus creating a larger set of potential synthetic controls, and the penalization term allows for the selection of the potential solution that will minimize bias. I study the properties of this estimator and propose a data-driven process for parameterizing the penalization term.

Since the advent of Uber and its competitors, people, especially city dwellers, have seen their lives transform through the convenience that rideshare platforms offer to them. However, the advantages provided by this system have been disproportionate across gender lines, as women have had to face numerous threats to their safety and security within the current rideshare framework. This problem is magnified in countries with high rates of gender-related abuse and crime. This paper explores the gaps that exist in modern rideshare platforms, networks and ecosystems from a safety centric lens. We establish a heuristic founded on complex networks, which we use to analyze the identified gaps in the rideshare system and understand the algorithmic approaches that different platforms take to address these gaps. We then focus on proposed solution hypotheses within this heuristic and perform a comparative analysis of the performance of the proposed solutions through different metrics that characterize the problem at hand. The framework of solutions discussed is intended to complement traditional ride-sharing platforms to allow for route and cost optimization to justify their business propositions while increasing their performance on the safety front. Hence, we conclude by discussing the quantitative and qualitative implications of implementing the proposed solutions.

Deepfakes are manipulated videos that are created using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). There is four open-source software to make these videos: DeepFake, Face2Face, FaceSwap, and FaceShifter. As such, this software became a handy tool to create visual evidence to fulfill harmful pursuits, such as revenge porn and falsified political campaigns. As the technology develops, deepfakes are faster to develop and are harder to detect. Thus, social media companies and law enforcement are in a rapid race to develop tools that see these videos to prevent them from spreading. As such, tremendous papers were published on the detection of these videos. However, the state-of-the-art papers use different datasets to train and validate their model, making it impossible to introduce a benchmark accuracy for detection models. In this paper, I use the FaceForensics2 dataset, the largest dataset for deepfakes, as a benchmark dataset that evaluates two state-of-the-art algorithms: Deepfakes Detection with Automatic Face Weighting and Use of a Capsule Network to Detect Fake Images and Videos.

Generally speaking, in sales, one has leads, those leads turn to calls, and those calls can turn into clients. In the context of a job search, the candidate has opportunities and recruiters (leads), which can then turn into a series of interviews (calls), and those could convert into offers (clients). At each stage of the process, there is only a chance that one moves to the next step, so the number of potential conversions gets lower and lower down the funnel. The key to success in this type of problem is two things: increasing the size of the funnel (applying for more jobs), and increasing the conversion rate at each stage of the funnel (improving resume quality, practicing interview techniques). Given today’s standard of online applications, most applicants report having problems with the top of their funnels, with 75% of resumes being rejected before ever reaching the hiring manager (Elmers, n.d) and a pool of up to 250 resumes per corporate job (Turczynski, 2020). Although there are tech products available to help job seekers manage their search, many of them are still quite new, while others suffer from issues like information overload and irrelevant features. Based on the pain points of today’s job seekers and the gap in adequate tech tools, there is a fit for an alternative job search pipeline management application with an emphasis on the early stages of the pipeline.","web platform, productivity, organization, jobs",App,"#cs110optimalalgorithm

For this research, we used Google’s speech-to-text and sentiment analysis algorithms to transcribe twenty Minerva School classes for each of four different professors, to investigate the plausibility of a causal relationship between the judgment in professors’ response (measured in terms of valence and intensity of sentiment expressed) and student participation in class (measured by talk time distributions, frequency of hand raises and use of emojis). After applying four different statistical tests, we saw no evidence that judgment decreases student engagement, and in fact saw increased engagement when professors used more strongly valenced language. We also found positive correlations between student grades and engagement in class, and negative correlations between the number of students in class and class contributions.","Science of Learning, Extrinsic Motivaiton, Intrinsic Motivation, Language, Natural Language Programming, Genetic Matching, Statistics, Education, Sentiment, Sentiment Analysis, Emotion, Emotional Language, Engagement, Feedback","Primary research (e.g., with a research group), Data analysis","#cs112decisiondata, #CS112decisioninference, #CS146interpretingprobabilities, #CS146probabilitytheory, #CS11Acomputationaltools, #CS156regressionalalgorithm, #CS156classification, #ss162typesofmotivation",,"Literature review skills, knowledge of factors affecting learning, network effects and their impact on motivation and psychological safety.

The causes of IBD remain unknown, but much evidence points to a defective immune system and the interplay between genetic and environmental factors. Recently, attention has been drawn to the role of the gut microbiome in IBD pathogenesis, and thanks to next-generation sequencing technologies, we have been able to sequence omics data from the gut and study the diseases from a microbial perspective. Many computational models, including Machine Learning and Deep Learning, have been developed to analyze meta-omic data; however, most studies only use one omics type and classify IBD without drawing biological insights.

Frame semantics is a study of linguistic meaning through the conception of frames, and even though FrameNet is one of the most fine-grained frame-semantic databases, it suffers from limited coverage of lexical units. Furthermore, FrameNet remains under-resourced for languages other than English. In this paper, we propose solutions to the two problems. The first solution expands the Berkeley FrameNet data release 1.7 (English version of FrameNet) by identifying new lexical units. The novelty here is that we use autoencoders to filter out lexical units that cannot fit into any existing semantic frame in FrameNet before assigning frame labels to them. Our solution has been published in the International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation 2020. Our second solution expands Berkeley FrameNet data release 1.7 beyond English resources through annotation projection. We propose using graph attention networks to project frame labels from English lexical units to non-English counterparts while taking into account frame shifts---a cross-linguistic phenomenon in translation that results in corresponding pairs of linguistic material evoking different frames.","Frame semantics, Deep Learning, Deep Clustering, Multilinguality, Graph Neural Networks","Primary research (e.g., with a research group)","#cs156overfitting, #cs156modelmetrics, #cs156neuralnetworks, #cs152aiconcepts, #cs152aicoding",,"Computational linguistics, natural language processing, deep learning, graph neural networks",,Natural Language Processing,N/A (no project involves interacting with any people and/or their data),Watson

First, it could accelerate the learning of physical intuition by constraining not only the search space of possible solutions but also guide the type of representation a neural network learns to achieve the task. Secondly, memory itself can be seen as an inductive bias. Currently, memory in deep learning methods is implicitly stored in the parameter of neural networks.

Bioinformatics is said to be applying computation and analysis knowledge to interpret the biological data (Payat, 2002). Over time, biological data availability has been increased significantly by the human genome project and sequencing projects in other organisms. As a result of such massive demand for analysis and interpretation, the field of Bioinformatics keeps evolving to supply researchers with the proper tools. Each of those tools tends to serve a narrow analytical goal based on the dataset it manages. Therefore, the field ended up with a very diverse set of tools matching the data's diversity.
Nonetheless, the underlying assumptions and formatting differ from tool to tool, making it hard to transfer information across platforms. For example, NCBI relies on the evolution relatedness which not always the case in some research and basic tools for CG content for example makes assumptions about the input being only ATGC which is not the case using IUPAC codes This ambiguity in the tools makes it harder to do the analysis or could lead to false analysis. On the other hand, the lack of technical coding knowledge among biology students and researchers prevents them from making a tool themselves (Wright, 2019). Therefore, they rely heavily on pre-made algorithms in their analysis. 

Most of the tasks that require a high level of analysis across different functions tend to be problematic and time consuming for researchers and students. This is due to the current design for web tools. Let's take building a regulatory network from the sequence of interest as an example of such a task. First of all, the user needs to get open reading frames to get the possible array of proteins. Then, they need to analyze such protein by using Protein BLAST searches to get the function of each protein. Next, they need to get the motifs in the sequences. Then, check the relative position of proteins and motifs. Finally, start working on analyzing the map of the gene to get the wanted network. This process is heavily reliant on human intervention, time-consuming, scattered across different tools. However, in our tool, the user will be presented with the ORF report, the motif report, and the gene map just by inputting the sequence. The reports' choice is made based on how well the information from each report could be integrated into each other and on the questions that researchers face at the beginning of a research. Therefore, our tool has four qualities that this tool has to offer over available tools in the field. They are the automation of the pipeline, Minimizing the assumptions, less computational power, and providing more data than just the features involved alone. 

Finally, this proposal aims to produce a GUI tool that will allow the user to discover unknown sequence characteristics. The pipeline will start from the nucleotides sequence to reach preliminary conclusions that could be useful to investigate as research questions.

The most at-risk populations for malaria are pregnant women and children under five years old (WHO, n.d.). According to Bauserman (2019), one hundred and twenty-five million pregnant women are currently at risk of malaria (Bauserman, 2019). Moreover, 10-20% of maternal mortality in malaria-endemic countries is related to malaria (Piper, 2020).

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends Intermittent Preventive Treatment in Pregnancy - Sulfadoxine Pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP). Though there is growing malaria resistance to IPTp-SP, it remains effective. However, only about 34% of pregnant women in Sub-Saharan African take the recommended number of IPTp-SP doses. One country that is doing well in terms of IPTp-SP coverage is Zambia. Therefore, this paper is first an analysis of the factors causing low IPTp-SP coverage based on multiple studies' findings. Furthermore, a case study analysis of the factors that helped Zambia improve its IPTp-SP coverage. Finally, the paper will conclude with evidence-based recommendations for increasing IPTp-SP coverage in Sub-Saharan African countries based on knowledge from the case study analysis and a behavior change model called the 'Health Belief Model.'

With a high case-fatality rate of 10-30% due to patients subsequently developing neurological and neuropsychopathic sequelae (Zhang et al., 2011), JE represents a significant public health risk. Despite the past success of vaccination programs in high-incidence regions, an estimated 68,000 infections and 13 600 to 20 400 deaths annually are reported (Campbell et al., 2011). 
Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is an incurable muscle-wasting disease that affects approximately 1 in 3500 boys (Nowak and Davies, 2004), with most patients unable to survive beyond their teens. 
The lethality and great burden imposed by both diseases predicates a search for novel  therapies. A high-potential avenue for JE and DMD treatment is based on stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (SC-EVs). 
This project aims to investigate how bioengineering approaches can augment EV-based nanoformulations for the amelioration of hypercytokinemia/excessive inflammation (a pathological hallmark in both conditions) and activation of regenerative processes. The focus is on exosomes: nanoscale biological structure originating from multivesicular bodies, which are secreted extracellularly through plasma fusion. The project analyses the utility of an exosomal approach versus a whole-cell method, and argues for the potential of exosomes as a flexible, multimodal treatment platform for incurable diseases. Various components of exosomes, such as exosomes' intrinsic macromolecular cargoes or surface functionalized chemistry, can be customized using engineering methods and gap analysis. Depending on the pathophysiological context, exosomes can be optimized to elicit therapeutic effects in many biological processes across different scales.

This process is dynamic with costs and benefits changing over time scales from days, to seasons, to individual lifetimes. These dynamics and the factors underlying them are poorly understood, but with the rise of suitable GPS tracking technology, new data has become available, with new challenges of inferring interactions from spatial relationships.
This capstone proposes a modification to an existing clustering algorithm and devises a methodology for tracking groups. This computational method allows the study of group-level and individual-level factors influencing fission-fusion dynamics.
We study 51 female sheep (Ovis aries) tracked over four 3-day periods in a 6km^2 paddock in the semi-arid region of Australia.
We find an increase in group density and stability during the night and mid-day, times when sheep usually rest and ruminate. This is consistent with decreased cost of intra- and inter-group competition for resources while benefit from predator protection and safety in numbers remains unchanged. Spatially, we find no pattern beyond the general increased time spent by food and water sources.
On an individual level, we find no consistent variation between individuals in their spatial social behavior, suggesting that cost and benefit on the group level drive the dynamics rather than individual needs or behavioral type. We test for the influence of boldness and exploration tendency and find no effect further supporting this hypothesis.","Sheep, Animal Behavior, Collective Movement, Complex Systems, Data Analysis, Observational Study, spatial data","Analysis/synthesis of existing works (possibly with proposal for future work), Primary research (e.g., with a research group), Data analysis","#cs110-novelapplication, #ns112-phenotypicplasticity, #ns112-ecorelationships, ","#AnimalBehavior (NS),  #MathematicaImplementation (CS)","Data Analysis, GIS, GPS, Linear Algebra, Complex Systems, Animal Behavior, Statistics, algorithmic thinking,",,Mathematica/ Wolfram Language,N/A (no project involves interacting with any people and/or their data),Kern

Effective climate change policy is one that is able to account for the diverse needs of different local-level communities, and balance the environmental and the social-justice aspects of climate change. Through a case study examining the State Action Plan for Climate Change for the Indian state of Odisha, this paper engages with different frameworks of policy development (broadly categorized as ‘top-down’ and ‘bottom-up’) and attempts to understand why local-level community needs may remain unaddressed in climate change policy solutions developed at higher-levels of of government (regional and national). The study is an improvement-focused case study, and its contextualization of the problem leads to the proposal of a solution to redesign an existing policy tool: the climate change vulnerability assessment, to capture community voices and thus work as a local-level feedback or channel in the process of climate change policy development (a ‘bottom-up feedback’).

Despite moose being well-suited to cold environment, populations in much of their range are thriving, including some areas thought to be too warm for this species. Historically, moose have adapted to new conditions relatively quickly to colonize most of the northern boreal forests, but the changes we are observing today are happening at an unprecedented speed and it is unknown if the current increases in population are sustainable or due to temporary conditions. At the same time, these large moose populations are altering the ecosystem dynamics in some regions, endangering the survival of other species. Further research considering how the moose responds to new conditions and interacts with its environment is necessary to make predictions and create appropriate management strategies to ensure the survival of the moose and surrounding species.","Moose, climate change, boreal forest, climate envelope, conservation",Analysis/synthesis of existing works (possibly with proposal for future work),"#ns166interactions,  #ns112ecorelationships, #ns111systemsthinking, #ns112phenotypicplasticity, #ns166disturbance",,"Ecology, climate envelope, GIS, energy cycling, networks, literature review writing, research.",,"Microsoft Office, music composition, zoology, ecology, paleontology",N/A (no project involves interacting with any people and/or their data),Kern

One form is the quantum spin Hall effect, QSHE, which paves the way for future advances in superconductivity and quantum computing. The QSHE represents the key to materials known as two-dimensional topological insulators, which have conducting edges, but non-conducting interiors. The description of such phases of matter and what distinguishes them from other trivial phases lies in the underlying topology of the system. This project addresses these exotic phases of matter and explores the connections between this phenomenon in 2D materials and the concept of topological order. Theoretical predictions and explanations for systems or materials experiencing topological, non-trivial, order rely mainly on electronic band structures which are obtained using models such as the tight-binding model. Canonical tight-binding models such as the Kane-Mele model describe simple systems or materials such as Graphene, which only experience a weak spin- orbit coupling (weak topological behavior; which we define later), making it hard to detect the quantum spin Hall effect in these systems experimentally. This project, therefore, targets other models such as the Hofstadter model, which can be generalized to a wide range of two-dimensional systems and can account for the effects of an external magnetic field or mechanical strain. We focus also on candidate materials or systems that experience high spin-orbit coupling, such as transition metal dichalcogenide, TMD, monolayers. The project employs numerical methods for calculating the topological invariants for the models of these systems. Computing the selected topological invariants is addressed using the Kubo formula method by (Thouless et al., 1982) as well as the Fukui-Hatsugai-Suzuki method by Fukui (Fukui et al., 2005) and Dauphin (Dauphin et al., 2014). The project not only covers the methods but also aims to explain the mathematical and physical underpinnings.","Quantum Spin Hall Effect

The aim of this project would be to search for decompositions satisfying some candidate weaker conditions and check whether they always exist. For that, a small one-dimensional tensor network can be used for numerically optimizing the parameters of an ansatz decomposition.","wavefunction branches, records of observables, numerical simulation, tensor networks","Analysis/synthesis of existing works (possibly with proposal for future work), Primary research (e.g., with a research group)","#ns142-operatortheory, #ns142-spaceofstates, #cs154-linalg, #cs154-mathmodel, #cs164-optimization",,Knowledge in quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics,,,N/A (no project involves interacting with any people and/or their data),Richard

Bioremediation is the use of living organisms to degrade waste; bioremediation techniques have been used commercially since the 1970s, when a process to accelerate the degradation of petroleum in waterways by feeding on-site bacteria with nutrients was developed and patented (Raymond, 1972 *Cite). Conventional bioremediation applications have been successful in a limited set of conditions to safely and efficiently degrade a limited set of contaminants. Developments in commercial biotechnology and modern sequencing tools have revolutionized the field of bioremediation research and are empowering a new generation of more sophisticated solutions to degrade a wider range of environmental pollutants. Ecologically designed contamination bioremediation applications are an especially promising frontier within the broader field of bioremediation. Fungi serve unique ecological roles that make them especially well suited for enhanced bioremediation, and they have recently gained unusual popularity amongst mycologists, environmental biotechnologists, and environmentalists alike as a promising key to the future of environmental cleanup. Generally speaking, the emergence of systems biology frameworks, driven by breakthroughs in next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics technologies, are improving the design and development of bioremediation solutions to better resolve our widespread planetary contamination problems.

Cities are expanding rapidly around the world in different patterns putting considerable stress on natural resources. Most of the urban development models in use today are outdated, with the core goal of making cities into economic powerhouses, therefore, misaligned with the requirements of a sustainable future. In order to address the impending challenges of climate change and to adapt to a growing urban population, our current development models need not only to adapt to the future challenges but also redefine their core objective to live in harmony with Mother Nature. This paper makes the case for a nature-centric approach towards urban development by leveraging the Public-Private Partnership (PPPs) mechanism that would enable such a pursuit. The approach, namely Biomorphic Synergetic Solutions with its merger with PPPs would lay the groundwork for the cities of the future, that is not only sustainable but also restorative in their relationship with nature. Moreover, this paper will analyze case studies that are already using such nature-centric solutions to retrofit cities and adapt them to climate change challenges.

However, intrinsically there have been some problems with history education in China due to the test-oriented pedagogical culture and the intertwined relationship between historiography and politics. In traditional history teaching in China, which aims for better preparation towards college entrance examination (Gaokao), students' history learning is mainly a process of passively receiving historical knowledge. In this kind of learning process, memorizing massive historical facts, existing interpretations, as well as contextualization on the textbook to cram for tests accounts for students' history learning, which leads to students retelling, memorizing, and even reciting the interpretations of historical evidence and conclusions as historical facts. However, how are these interpretations constructed? What is the definition of history and the past? Can students have their own perspectives on history? Such questions regarding historical thinking are often ignored by educators. More importantly, what trapped history education in China is that it has been used as a tool to fulfill political purposes, and the historical narratives educated to students through textbooks are all ideologically dominated by a single Marxist framework of historical materialism.

Therefore, the purpose of this research project is to make history education in Chinese secondary schools more engaging and rigorous, incorporating sophisticated pedagogies and learning theories, while fitting the Chinese context. The project will begin with the illustration of Constructivism and its pedagogical value through Project-Based Learning as an example; then unravel why history education in China has been underdeveloped through the deconstruction of power dynamics in the politicization of Marxist, nationalist narrative framework in history education and historical silences of Marxist historical materialism with influential academic research and official documentation from the government. In the last main section, inspired by existing academic research in the field and cases in other education systems, I will design a curriculum to propose the next steps on how to reform the current secondary history education in China with a constructivist approach, incorporating principles in constructivism learning theory, project-based learning, active learning, and collaborative learning into practice.",,Educational curriculum/materials,"#ah162-historyandmemory

Qualified Immunity and Legal Use of Force by Police Across the United States,"Police officers are expected to serve and protect civilians. Cases of police officers harming, sometimes killing, people they are expected to serve and protect have led to protests, calls for reforms, and disputes about roles of police officers. Analyzing data for the 50 U.S. states and Washington, D.C., this study examines whether legal protections police officers possess are associated with excessive use of force against civilians. This study finds that civilian killings by police tend to be higher in states whose governments are characterized as beyond civilian control. Where Republicans control state government and police officers enjoy broad protections, police killings of civilians tend to be higher. This study finds that racial conflict may be a powerful factor related to police killings of civilians. Reforms should not only concentrate on protections police enjoy, but structures shaping their efforts to serve and protect civilians.","Police, Policing, United States of America, Data Science, Python, Qualified Immunity, Use of Force, QCA","Policy paper, Data analysis","#SS112institutions, #SS112politicalorder, #SS112socialmobilization, #CS166interpretresults, #CS112decisiondata, #CS112decisiondesign, #CS112decisionanalysis","#IL181.016PracticalDataScienceprocess (from Practical Data Science Tutorial): Work steadily, communicating what you are doing to your team.

Many debates in teaching methods focus on whether or not various teaching techniques, such as teacher questioning or graded participation, are effective or not. For example, Dallimore et al. (2012) argue that instructors should cold-call often to increase student participation, yet Rocca(2010), and  Cooper & Brownwell (2020) suggest cold-calling should be avoided due to its impact on student anxiety. This objectivist approach fails to consider the complexity of multidimensional classrooms and the impact of context on teaching practices. Therefore, we argue that an effective teaching technique is better understood by how, when, and why it is applied. 
Using quantitative and qualitative survey data (n = 138)  at an online active-learning institution, we investigate the interplay between emotion and cognition. Particularly, how cold-calling, group work and class structure influence students' comfort, anxiety, attention and engagement in class. Contextually, we analyze whether changes between gender, class level, academic major, or STEM vs non-STEM students exist when applying those techniques. Sophomore, junior and sophomore year students showed significant differences in terms of comfort. Moreover, natural and social science students were less comfortable with cold-calling than business, computational sciences, and humanities students. In terms of gender, female students tend to avoid cold-calling at a higher rate compared to male students. The data also suggest that student preparedness, group work, and class size can determine the effectiveness of a teaching technique. Participants have also put a larger emphasis on professors’ attitude whether the teaching technique of cold-calling is effective or not.","Active Learning, Student Motivation, Cold-Calling, Feedback","Analysis/synthesis of existing works (possibly with proposal for future work), Primary research (e.g., with a research group)","#NS272-WorkinContext, #NS272-litreview, #NS272-FruitfulDirections, , #NS272-DataAnalysis, #IL181-EducationPsychology, #IL181-AppliedEducation, #IL181-Evidencebased, #SS142-EmotionInluenceonCognition, #SS110-SelfReportMeasures.",,"Literature review, Survey Design, Data Analysis",,,Approved by HSR committee: Not considered HSR,Connolly

In order to do so, the project takes into account some key normative theories of democracy using theories from psychology to explore whether the assumptions made by democratic theory about human nature correspond with what is currently known by psychology. The project analyzes these theories of democracy using theories from psychology to explore whether they are precisely accounting for how humans think and behave according to the current knowledge of the psychology field, as well as to think about when these normative theories may have shortcomings due to the lack of considerations about human cognition and behavior. While democracy and the key concepts surrounding it have existed for centuries and even millennia, most of the field from psychology is very recent in human history, as many of these theories are not even a century old. Considering this disparity of age between the two fields, this project aims to bring new insights into the field of democratic theory by taking into account these considerations of human cognition and behavior.","Democracy, Psychology, Normative Democratic Theory, Representative Democracy, Minimalist Democracy, Deliberative Democracy, Decision-Making, Group Dynamics",Philosophy paper,"

However, most of us still do not factor in the environmental footprint of the products we buy as a deciding factor with the potential to stir us away from some products and towards others. To adapt to this consumer demand, and to remain competitive, it is in the best interest of consumer goods companies to provide consumers with more agency and variety to align their purchasing power with their values. There is a wealth of research on human behavior change and the climate sciences that have proved humans caused the climate crisis and, more specifically, humans' addiction to consumption. Thus, for the planet, consumers, and businesses, understanding the behavior science behind sustainable consumption is critical. As a research deliverable, the paper will synthesize the existing research on behavior change for sustainable consumption, and use these insights to propose practical and effective ways for consumers to engage first-hand with businesses and drive positive, and sustainable, change.

Cognitive behavioral models of SAD suggest that dysfunctional cognitive and behavioral factors create a maladaptive feedback cycle that leads to a long term maintenance of SAD. I propose that drama therapy interventions can effectively treat SAD by dismantling the maladaptive feedback cycles. To support this claim, I first break down SAD and drama therapy into a group of individual components, after which I explore the potential causal links between the two. Then, I review currently existing empirical research findings and offer my own theoretical arguments on how the core individual processes of drama therapy can interact with the individual components of SAD and disable the maladaptive feedback cycle. Finally, I discuss future research directions and describe some of the ways we can further explore drama therapy as a treatment modality for SAD.

This capstone expands on the benefits of coworking beyond a strictly business concept.  Research on the benefits of the coworking model has shown it promotes innovation, the creation of social capital as well as trust and cooperation. This model can foster sustainable economic development and reduce biases and hostility between Jews and Arabs with intentional planning and structural design principles. However,  these qualities have never been studied in the context of a society in conflict.  Hence, this capstone begins to fill the gap by offering a theoretical framework for adapting the benefits of coworking spaces into a model targeting Jews and Arab business ventures based in northern Israel within the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

To establish these claims, I review literature in trade, development, and structural change to build a structural model explaining tariff differences' heterogeneity. To calculate the tariff differences, I build a metric that takes the difference in tariffs levied on agricultural and non-agricultural products by the OECD, which shows that tariff differentials are more pronounced in developing countries. After dealing with missing data using multiple imputations through chained equations and an averaging approach, I model the relationship between tariff differentials placed on nations by the OECD and change in employment in manufacturing using a panel data regression and an inverse probability of treatment weighting adjusted regression. I find that the panel data model cannot find that tariff differences explain differences in structural transformation but that the inverse probability of treatment weighing can find tariff differences to have a statistically significant effect on structural transformation.","International Trade, Economics, Tariffs, Trade, Structural Change, Development Economics, Political Economy ","Policy paper, Analysis/synthesis of existing works (possibly with proposal for future work), Primary research (e.g., with a research group), Data analysis","#ss154data,

In 2020, Grassroots Economics’ Community Inclusion Currency (CIC) model was adopted by the Kenya Red Cross as a humanitarian response to the Covid-19 pandemic. This study takes existing research a step further by providing experimental evidence on the impact of CIC transfers in Nairobi. Unlike most unconditional cash transfer programs, recipients are sent cryptographic tokens rather than cash or mobile money, enabling an unprecedented level of trade data via blockchain analytics. Results show that small-scale transfers of ~$30 USD sent as CIC tokens have statistically significant economic impacts on beneficiaries, with a $86.48 USD increase in available income, a $6.60 USD increase in average trade size and a $24.94 USD increase in expenditure on food and water. However, the difference in magnitude of positive treatment effects for male versus female receipients suggests that gender imbalances persist. Women show a lower marginal propensity to consume, indicating a preference to save additional income as a buffer against unpredictable cash flow.

The circular economy concept addresses this problem by redefining human consumption flows as a closed-loop system (where waste is reintegrated into production processes instead of being disposed of) that is regenerative and resilient by design. Currently, circular economy efforts are championed at the business level, where circularity is defined by retaining and reinvesting material inputs to produce goods and services that meet triple bottom line goals. Academics, companies, and foundations have developed various measurements to capture how “circular” a company or industry within the broader economy is. However, no such “circular” indicator exists that holistically measures circularity at the US city-level. A composite “circular” indicator would aggregate multiple dimensions of an urban circular economy to provide a holistic, intentional circularity measurement at the city level. Such a composite indicator is important to assess the effectiveness of different circular economy initiatives within a city, support comparative analyses between cities, and set benchmarks for advancing the transition to a sustainable circular economy. The aim of this project is to address this need for a holistic “circular” indicator and improve assessments of urban circular transitions. Drawing on extensive research, comprehensive mapping of existing circular indicators, and synthesizing key learnings from these indicators, this paper analyzes their potential to scale to cities. Outcomes from this analysis inform the construction of a holistic circular city indicator which is tested to measure circularity in a select city in the United States.",,"Policy paper, Analysis/synthesis of existing works (possibly with proposal for future work), Data analysis","#SS164alternativemodels, #SS164economicinfluences, #SS144economicprinciples, #SS164-economicgrowthordevelopment, #SS144-economicproblemsolving, #IL181.012-SocialLens",,"Data visualization, circular economy theory & related schools of thought (biomimicry, industrial ecology, etc.), circular economy design (Ellen Macarthur Foundation, Circular Economy [in Amsterdam], Closed Loop Partners, etc.), indicator theory and development ",,"Sustainable, ethical, and fair clothing and footwear shopping, startup incubator management, government consulting.",N/A (no project involves interacting with any people and/or their data),Davis

The United Nations Office on Drug and Crime (UNDOC) has reported in 2013 that an estimated 246 million people between the ages of 15-64 years used illegal drugs, and almost 27 million people were dependent on illicit drugs worldwide with 12.19 million of the dependent users using injection as the primary means to consumption, and 1.65 million of the injecting users suffering from HIV (UNDOC, 2020). Since the 1960s, most Western societies have engaged in a prohibitive approach to the regulation of the drug trade, and, as can be observed from these statistics, this approach has been largely unsuccessful (Bretteville-Jensen, 2006). The infamous ‘War on Drugs’ has resulted in unprecedented levels of incarceration, particularly of individuals belonging to socioeconomically disadvantaged groups, and has resulted in an increased burden on the legal, healthcare, and law enforcement systems (Bretteville-Jensen, 2006). Not only has this approach been unsuccessful in deterring the sale and purchase of drugs, but has also resulted in a higher number of deaths from overdose since the fear of criminal proceedings disincentivizes individuals from approaching emergency rooms and healthcare facilities to combat their addiction (Woods, 2011). 

Hence, it is imperative to explore alternative approaches towards addressing the drug trade, and the existing knowledge of repugnant transactions as well as successful decriminalization models adopted by countries like Portugal can provide insight into better approaches to regulating the drug trade.

Internships have an impact on the economy via changes in the labor market, but this impact is still under-researched. With the number of entry-level jobs decreasing and employers expecting experience from recent graduates, economic and social theories suggest that unequal access to internships may perpetuate socioeconomic inequality. This paper explores the research question, “To what extent do internships affect social mobility via changes of opportunity in the labor market and what does this imply for socioeconomic inequality?” The literature review suggests that internship experience improves labor market outcomes, but extensive research on who (based on key demographics) gets access to internships is minimal. An exploratory analysis of the 1997 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth dataset attempts to shed insight on access to internships. However, insignificant and negligible results due to a small sample size (n = 24) of individuals who indicated participating in internships confirms a significant need for more rigorous research. The paper concludes with a future research framework and a research proposal for an experimental encouragement design focused on the intergenerational mobility of low-income students. Disclaimer: This paper does not discuss the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, which has shifted the state of the intern economy and warrants research on its impact.

A core element of democracy is informational transparency and literacy –– without the guarantee that citizens may access or remove their own data or that corporations must relinquish data holdings or explicitly state what consumer data is used for, the potential for manipulative marketing or unethical data use is high.

An optimistic approach would be an constitutional amendment to the Bill of Rights with explicit provisions for internet activity, but given the nature of the problem and context of American politics, a more strategic method would be the introduction of a bill that synthesizes points presented in S.2968 and S.189.","Policy Proposal, Policy Analysis, Data Rights, Ethics, Governance, United States Politics","Philosophy paper, Policy paper, Analysis/synthesis of existing works (possibly with proposal for future work)"," #ah144ethicalconflicts, #ah144ethicalframing, #ah144ethicaltheory, #ah154distinctions, #ah154legalauthority, #ah154legalcaseanalysis, #ah154constitutions, #ah154domesticlaw, #ah154intlaw #ah154rights, #ss146governancereach #ss146governancereform #ss146societaltrust #ss146governanceeffectiveness #ss146governancecapacity #ss146politicalideology #ss146inclusivegovernance #ss156bureaucracyoperations #ss156governmentaspects #ss156govtrelations #ss156roleoforganizations ##ss156formalrules #ss156informalrules #ss156agentsandoutcomes #ss156rulesandoutcomes #ss156govtandpolicyagents #ss166executivencroachment #ss166constitution #ss166ruleoflaw #ss166contextualfactors #judiciaryandcourts #ss166legislativestructure #ss166regimetype",,"- UDemy -- WebDev course, to gain an understanding of how websites are built + how data is stored

In this paper, I will take the first step towards establishing the Polish national suicide prevention strategy. Performing a multi-level analysis of the suicide problem in Poland and evaluating past suicide prevention actions the government engaged in, I will identify Poland’s at-risk populations and flaws in the current mental health system. I will conclude the paper by outlining the government’s next steps in its suicide prevention efforts. Specifically, I recommend that Poland tackle stigmas surrounding men’s mental health, increase its provision of care by engaging stakeholders at all levels, set up re-integration mechanisms for patients who have spent time in inpatient psychiatric recovery centres, and improve its data collection efforts.

Migrant workers play an indispensable role in Singapore’s economy, but one report suggests over 60% are exploited and abused by their employers (Wessels, Ong, & Daniel, 2017). In 2018 they made up 38% of the workforce, 1.386 million workers in total, of which 84.3% hold highly restrictive work visas known as work permits (MOM, 2020). The system in Singapore is split into two tracks, with the low-skilled and high-skilled workers, colloquially referred to as migrants and expats respectively (Dodgson, 2017). The overarching challenge and fundamental question when it comes to migration policies globally, is how to frame and weigh the perspectives and rights of the multiple stakeholders involved (Dodgson, 2017). 

The intended outcome of this project is a comprehensive policy proposal for the Singapore Government regarding migrant worker policies, with a focus on MDW’s, with a focus on five disciplines for the analysis: Political Science, Economics, Philosophy, Sociology, and Diplomacy. The problem statement is: how should Singapore redesign its migration policies and regulatory system so that they are a) more progressive, and b) more inclusive in terms of stakeholder interests and rights?

We take actions to come closer to embodying our ideal identity. The process of defining this ideal identity is thus one of paramount importance to the direction of our lives. 
This Capstone researches this process through the question: ""What should be the parameters of a structured approach that enables the formulation of a framework to define and work towards one's ideal identity?""
This work is nested within the Integral Movement, which is a comprehensive update to the Human Potential Movement, and for the research I will use a constructivist paradigm to conduct a literature review on psychology and political theory among other disciplines in the social sciences to define these parameters. 
Drawing on answers of this inquiry, I will explain the Meta-Bookshelf as the structured approach which can enable that and provide an example that meets the highest standards according to these parameters. 

Ultimately the intention is to make this conceptual tool accessible to people through a coaching sub-modality and a training and development platform, called ""Evo-biosis"" - a multi-dimensional infrastructure to educate 18-25 year olds to participate in the creation of the world that their hearts long for.

The thesis will begin with a discussion of the food system and the efforts thus far to address food security, wherein I will argue that these efforts have tried to address the problem from within the current, corporatised food system and have proven to be insufficient in part because they do not address power asymmetries in the food system or the negative environmental impacts of industrialised agricultural systems. I will then argue that studying alternative models can help us to reimagine fundamentally different food systems that put social justice and sustainability, as well as feeding people, at the forefront.

Then, I will perform 3 in-depth case studies of the following groups: Belo Horizonte (Brazil), Thumturakit (Thailand), and MASIPAG (Philippines). Each of these groups has successfully self-organised in alternative social and agricultural structures to create food systems that run in parallel to the dominant one but are based in entirely different logic. The case studies will be conducted using a combination of secondary research and informational interviews with representatives of the groups. 

Finally, after conducting the case studies, I will consolidate the lessons that can be derived from these alternative models of organisation and propose how they might redirect food security endeavours towards a pathway that meets the interconnected goals of feeding the world, preserving the integrity of environmental systems, and adhering to principles of justice.
