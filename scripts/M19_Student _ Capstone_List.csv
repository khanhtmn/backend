I contextualize this local issue by analyzing higher levels of analysis using this model, and propose a set of recommendations for other cities to address financial exclusion.

Through this paper, I argue that, unlike the approaches taken in developing economies, where a large percentage of the population is fully financially excluded, interventions addressing “last-mile financial inclusion” (giving access to the last part of a society that remains financially excluded) in developed urban centers requires a new definition and model to understand the issue. The model I propose emphasizes how cultural and communication challenges, awareness of existing solutions and financial capability as well as the economic and financial environments affect the financially excluded in urban developed economies.

""Efficient Calculation of Lattice Green's Functions in Disordered Systems""",,"Calculating Green's function for quantum particles on lattice potentials is an important method of study in condensed matter physics.

Calculating Green's functions faces significant computational challenges since the state space of quantum systems is very high- dimensional due to the superposition of multiple basis eigenstates. In this work I present a novel method to calculate lattice Green's functions using methods of binary search rather than directly engaging with the Hamiltonian and calculating these functions from first principles, rapidly cutting down on computational resources required at the cost of accuracy. This method involves extending the work of [18] by studying the sparse distribution of matrix elements to determine the importance of each matrix element towards the calculation of the Green's functions.

""Product Development: A Fad Or A Trend?""",,"Sustainable fashion is a concept that has been sensationalised by the media.

The hypothesis is that if sustainable fashion is indeed a trend, then the sales growth rate of the first two categories will be much higher than that of the last category. The findings do not produce any conclusive results. I then present the data from an observational study conducted to understand customer purchasing priorities. I find that customers prioritise cost over the need for sustainability. For the third part, I analyse investor trend and uncover that high growth industry investors do not include sustainable fashion companies in their portfolio, indicating that the market does not believe it is a lasting trend. Lastly, I analyse industry laws, and even this shows that there are no regulations in place to strongly motivate fashion companies to adopt sustainable practices.

""Code as Design - An exploration into best practices for the development of sustainable
software systems""",,"If code were written by computers, it could be arbitrarily complex. The code could represent something close to a dish of spaghetti, and as long as the computer understood how to read and write it, software development wouldn’t require much effort. The problem, however, is that humans are the primary writers, and readers, of original (not compiled) code. As Robert Martin stated in his book Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship, “Indeed, the
ratio of time spent reading versus writing is well over 10 to 1. We are constantly reading old code as part of the effort to write new code. ...[Therefore,] making it easy to read makes it easier to write” (Martin, R. C., Coplien, J. O., Wampler, K., et al, 2016). Since humans are not computers, and cannot handle anywhere near the level of complexity computers can, the software development process focuses on reducing complexity. Thus, measures that aim to
reduce the complexity of a system’s codebase are worthwhile investments and are a core part of designing and building the system.

""Manifest Prospectus""",,"The fashion industry is composed of primarily linear supply chains where goods flow from manufacturing (factory production) to distributors and end in the consumer’s hands. Post-consumer fashion waste typically ends up in landfills or incinerated. This type of production is unsustainable because it puts pressure on resources during production, while the customer uses the garment, and after consumption. The pressure on the environment is only mounting with increased consumption patterns and the “fast-fashion movement.” Fortunately, new innovations are being invented to “close the loop” and make fashion circular, such that the outputs (post-use garment waste) become the inputs to make the next product. This is possible via one proposed innovation of recycling old garments by shredding and recreating new clothes in a similar process that, additionally, places less stress on natural resources such as water, fuel, and electricity to power the machines. The technology is popular, but has not been evaluated for its true impact on the environment.

In order to do this, it is necessary to understand more clearly what such an obligation looks like both in theory and in practice. As such, my goal in this project is to provide insight into the nature of the obligation to further just institutions, and to provide a paradigm for understanding and analyzing the form this theoretical obligation takes in practice. In the first part of the paper, I argue that an institution is just if and only if it exemplifies a just end-state and if the process of achieving such an end-state was in accordance with the principles of justice. I show the concomitant necessity of a cohesive framework for furthering just institutions, one that reconciles the importance of process with the importance of outcome. In the second part of this paper, I evaluate several potential reconciliations of these two approaches, ultimately arguing that an integration of prefigurative politics and mere civility meets the criteria for reconciliation that I established in Part I.

""Rethinking Entrepreneurship Education in Rwanda: A Focus on Soft Skills""",,"This paper explores an applied research project whose purpose was to use the science of learning to design and pilot an evidence-based Entrepreneurial Leadership(EL) program. The creation of the program was inspired by the research and gap analysis I did on the high school entrepreneurship course in Rwandan schools. The research shed light on the lack of focus on soft skills that I will argue are important for the success of 21st-century entrepreneurs. The gap identified was that of soft skills that complement the hard skills that students learn in their entrepreneurship course. This gap consequently informed the design of a minimally viable version of a program that would complement the entrepreneurship course for grade 11 and 12, with a focus on the soft skills not previously emphasized. After the design, the program was piloted with six freshmen students at Minerva Schools who took a pre-test and a post-test to measure whether there were any changes in creativity as well as to capture the baseline understanding of the concepts that were introduced in the pilot program. Whilst the differences in creativity were not significant, this was to be expected of the pilot since it was only five days. However, as evidenced by the post-program survey, participants acquired tangible problem-solving skills as well and learned leadership paradigms from which to assess the quality of leadership. Final conclusions suggest that the next iteration of the program should be longer and recruit Rwandan participants in order to understand an average baseline for Rwandan grade 11 and 12 students. Additionally, the next iteration should modify the creativity test used in this pilot to take into consideration the particulars of creative thinking that the EL program is targeting, so as to be able to accurately assess any changes that might have occurred.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NvKOXR9sCl7YJpBUD0gvx6sP7OVp8AEw/view,,,X.027,Randi Doyle,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nUDByF2o1oG4oSOI1wdc9agQGTHbh8_B8-arJEJwXPg/edit

Incidence and deaths have been found to significantly decrease throughout the years due to improved therapies (GBD 2015 Mortality and Causes of Death Collaborators, 2016). One such therapy is hormone blocking therapy. Since some breast cancer cells have receptors that attach to estrogen (Knight, Livingston, Gregory, & McGuire, 1977), this can be targeted to stop cancer cells from growing and spreading. Tamoxifen is a drug that has been used to block the estrogen receptors so cancer cells will be unable to bind to estrogen (Jordan, 2003). Long-term adjuvant tamoxifen therapy was found to develop acquired resistance wherein tumors eventually resist treatment and induce growth, becoming tamoxifen-dependent (Wolf & Jordan, 1993). However, tamoxifen-dependent tumors were also found to be vulnerable to physiologic estrogen after resistance has developed. This began the research on estrogen-induced apoptosis (Jordan, 2014).

In 3D patch-based lung nodule detection, for example, only 1% of all sampled volumes contain a nodule. To alleviate class imbalance, we propose using a 3D residual Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty and an auxiliary classifier loss to synthesize fake samples that contain lung nodules to augment the imbalanced dataset, and then train a classifier with the generatively augmented dataset. We demonstrate that the GAN is able to generate novel samples distinct from the training set images, and that the generatively augmented classifier has a slightly lower sensitivity but significantly reduced false positive rate, improved F1 score, and higher precision compared to the baseline model.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1354p-XVejX_Denwu_aFtjzaDBL430ZR9/view,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s3mPbboOZUie7WybepfFV3Ni63kt7NxB/view,,X.041,Tony Drummond,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nUDByF2o1oG4oSOI1wdc9agQGTHbh8_B8-arJEJwXPg/edit

""How research into immigrants’ speech may change the way we learn languages online""",,"This paper introduces an online language learning application based on the principles of untutored second language acquisition. The theoretical motivation for this application comes from Klein and Perdue’s (1997) finding that second language acquisition outside the classroom can result in structurally simple yet highly expressive linguistic systems. A review of the language learning literature informed the practical implementation of the application. Two central concepts are core to the application: Firstly, the user is given lexical translations of the target language input, enabling her to learn the semantics of the target language. Secondly, the presentation of the language input optimizes the user’s implicit learning of the syntax of the
target language. Through these two concepts, the application teaches the user the two essential pillars of language: semantics and syntax. Additionally, since lexical translations from English exist for most living languages, the application can be used by speakers of almost any source language.

Users used to read physical newspapers to seek knowledge and stay updated on their  local communities. Now, Google has addressed the need to search for information about any given topic, while Facebook has enabled digital consumers to connect with anyone and everyone. Narratives are no longer merely fed to society; narratives have instead begun to be shaped by users, albeit with a plague of misinformation.

The news industry has also struggled with profitability since moving from analog to digital.

However, this phenomenon, called colexification, exhibits different patterns in different world languages. In this paper, we hypothesize that mental association contributes significantly to colexification, such that pairs of strongly associated meanings will be colexified more often than pairs of less associated meanings. We test this hypothesis on a large scale dataset of 279 world languages, using psychological and word embedding data as predictors. Among five distinct models (i.e., mental association, similarity, concreteness, valence, frequency), mental association is consistently found to be the most important factor in colexification patterns. We demonstrate that colexification patterns vary from one language to another, but they are not arbitrary; instead they reflect a tendency toward cognitive economy.

To mitigate the risk of SMEs collapsing, business owners should consider developing a structured business operations plan and framework. This approach has the potential to not only help entrepreneurs focus on the specific steps necessary for their organization to succeed, but it can also aid them in achieving their short-term and long-term business objectives. To illustrate the potential success that a typical SME in Kenya might achieve, a business plan for the clothing retail SME, Jafari Entreprise (which is in Nairobi in its fourth year of existence) has been developed. The aim of this plan is helping the business adopt a change management process that will set the company up for long-term sustainable existence beyond five years.

Natalie,Kanter,2019063,SS,AH,"Uniting Theory and Practice: Understanding INGOs, Maximizing Public Engagement, and Bolstering Mass Mobilization","How politically-oriented international NGOs use communication to address challenges within their particular country and political contexts, and motivate citizen engagement. 

""Improvements to INGOs’ Communication Campaigns Creation for Mass Mobilization""",,"This article is an exploration of international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) and the communication strategies they employ to motivate public engagement with their causes. Through this study, I begin to address concerns within the larger academic debate about INGOs provision of public goods and services by investigating how INGOs that work in public engagement communicate with the public given their respective contexts, and how they might do it more effectively given the wealth of interdisciplinary literature on persuasion and mass communication. Data for this research was collected through 11 interviews with employees working at 11 large INGOs that have a focus on public engagement. Both the methods for establishing preliminary interview questions and the methods for analyzing the data gathered from the interviews were based off of grounded theory. The participant sample is comprised of employees of Bangladeshi, British, Cambodian, Canadian, Colombian, and US American nationalities. Ultimately, I determine that INGOs are failing to maximize the impact of their communication strategies, because they focus on engaging a sympathetic demographic already predisposed to taking action. Building on the literature of mass communication and persuasion theories, I propose that INGOs should tailor their content and mediums of communication towards specific demographics. I also suggest that INGOs adopt an agile approach to relevant success measurement, which will lead to frequent adaptation of communication strategy.  These recommendations, if implemented, have the potential to expand the impact that INGOs have, empowering them to bolster the movements they aim to build. By equipping readers with both a tactical, real-world analysis and by referencing relevant academic literature, this article is meant to serve an academic-practitioner audience.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/14qMT_TBjH9SsOaG6Sm0NUlDfuPYWMECm/view,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LWhjIxmToHOSUQAb4jrGKryr3-WQDVsr/view,,X.063,Erin Kamler,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nUDByF2o1oG4oSOI1wdc9agQGTHbh8_B8-arJEJwXPg/edit

Cannabinoids, the primary active compounds in the Cannabis plant, have a wide variety of therapeutic effects, and specific cannabinoids are established as an anti-inflammatory treatment. It has also been demonstrated that combinations of cannabinoids can show synergism which leads to stronger anti-inflammatory effects at lower doses. Based on that, we will perform a screening experiment which will aim to find such synergism by exploring multiple combinations of cannabinoids and identifying their level of anti-inflammatory effects in the context of atherosclerosis. This paper lays the foundations for the experiment with a theoretical and practical background.

""The Effect of Parenthood on Happiness at Varying Income Levels: A Summary""",,"The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the effect of parenthood on reported happiness at different levels of income. Past research suggests that having children has a negligible or negative effect on parent happiness. These estimates are usually made on cross-sectional data and suggest a either no effect or low negative effect of parenthood on reported wellness measures. This paper explores the General Social Survey dataset for the USA, a time series dataset that follows over 6000 individuals for 6 years. Using this data, I compare happiness of non-parents and parents before and after childbirth, and estimate the effect of having a child on one’s happiness. The estimations are made with both a fixed-effect model and a matching-based model where the effect of treatment on the treated (ATT) is estimated.

My findings suggests a non-significant negative effect of having children on happiness. The estimation only holds for ATT, and there was not adequate data to estimate the effect on the childless group. Since the data was limited and the only population evaluated was of USA residents, this does not necessarily translate to other countries, and additional data and analysis is needed.

Skye,Hersh,2019083,AH,CS,Generalizability Is Not the Goal: Breaking into the Black Box of Rigorous Evaluations in International Development,"A critical examination of prevailing methodologies used to evaluate programs meant to alleviate poverty. 

""GENERALIZABILITY IS NOT THE GOAL: BREAKING INTO THE BLACK BOX OF RIGOROUS EVALUATIONS IN INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT""",,"Detractors of the rigorous evaluation movement suggest that the movement espouses a one-size-fits-all approach to policy (Pawson & Tilley, 1997; Cartwright, 2010; Cartwright & Munro, 2010; Cartwright & Deaton, 2018). These critics suggest that rigorous evaluators (sometimes known as randomistas ) treat the populations that they study as black boxes, as they assume that a policy intervention that works (or does not work) in one place will work (or will fail to work) in others, regardless of cultural, economic, or sociopolitical context. Clearly, this kind of assumption is imprudent. A number of studies show that the results of a given intervention do not always generalize across time and space (Pritchett & Sandefur, 2013; Bold et al., 2013; Vivalt, 2017). To address this issue, I propose that the rigorous evaluation community should not focus on the potential generalizability of programs, but on their potential transferability . That is, the community should not aim to accredit programs as universally applicable (e.g., as generalizable), but to discern the contextual conditions under which they will or will not work (e.g., as conditionally transferable).

""Algorithmic Bias and Targeted Advertising""",,"This project aims to understand one facet of algorithmic bias and how it shapes online environments for different users. I use an empirical study to explore how targeted advertising algorithms may discriminate based on race. While not always explicitly gathering information indicating race, algorithms can use stand-ins for racial categories including an individuals name, geographic location, interests, or even member organizations (e.g attending Howard University would indicate a user is African-American). Much of this information is captured by a user’s web-history. 

In my experiment, I simulate online profiles to exhibit job-searching behavior along with either a generic web history for the control group (visiting the top 50 sites in the US) or web history associated with African-Americans for the treatment group (the top 50 websites under African-American on alexa.com). By having these simulated online profiles run through and catalogue the ads they encounter, I evaluate whether there are systematic and significant differences in themes of advertisements targeted to these different groups of users. Although users with different web histories can expect to see different advertisements, there were significant differences between the number of ads featuring education opportunities between the control and treatment group (p value =.32). I also found that the treatment group saw less ads featuring ‘opportunities’ overall: related to education, housing, or career. These findings suggest that Google’s advertising algorithms discriminate based on race. Although further research must be done to evaluate the consistency and extent of such effects, these findings provide evidence that a racialized web-history can exclude an individual from valuable opportunities. As the ad ecosystem is opaque, with multiple stakeholders and incentives at play, I am unable to pinpoint the source of such biases. However, I will discuss what implications this targeting might have, and potential points of mitigation (for users, governmental regulatory bodies, and companies).

""Prospectus""",,"As cities continue to expand in the 21st century, there is a growing need to develop a deeper understanding of the spatial distribution of a city’s population. Policy makers are constantly
seeking for better models to predict residential patterns of different income groups to identify areas with high social risks, design future infrastructure, and plan affordable housing complex. Agent-based modeling is a powerful tool for revealing system dynamics and understanding how simple individual behaviors following prescribed rules can give rise to emergent properties. This paper presents an agent-based model that focuses on examining the residential dynamics of different income groups. Agents are endowed with heterogeneous income and social capital to choose their residences under a housing market mechanism that responds to income inequality. The model builds upon the traditional urban economic theories and simulates how individuals make residential choices given the tradeoff of between job opportunities and housing price. We found that residential patterns are qualitatively different based on income and these patterns are sensitive to the changes in the total population, housing market responsiveness, and income group ratio. In particular, our model replicates how urban processes, such as gentrification and poverty concentration in the inner-city, emerge when the housing market responds to residents’ demands. The model outcomes also reveal power dynamics between income groups such that those with higher income can have more power to impact the locations of others, and sometimes even force them to settle in suboptimal choices. We suggested this model to help urban planners and policymakers to better understand the complexity of residential dynamics, but further extensions are required to make posterior predictions that can be integrated into the planning practices.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1elpwA3Xi_bW6NSxWFX2Jla9BtuvU6J4g/view,,,X.101,Josh Fost,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nUDByF2o1oG4oSOI1wdc9agQGTHbh8_B8-arJEJwXPg/edit

""Development of Hematopoietic CRISPR-dCas9 Gene Activation for Hemophilia A Therapy""",,"Due to mutations in the blood clotting factor VIII (FVIII) gene, Hemophilia A patients often suffer from increased bleeding and while existing factor replacement therapy alleviates such symptom, gene therapy has been attracting major attention because it offers the prospect of a lifelong cure. Nevertheless, it can be impeded with multiple challenges, ranging from the inability of stably introducing exogenous vectors into cells to the difficulty of guaranteeing sufficient level of FVIII expression. Hoping to overcome such limitations, this study explores the potential of Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat (CRISPR)-dCas9 mediated gene activation for increasing the endogenous production of FVIII within human hematopoietic cells as an alternative Hemophilia A treatment. The novel application was established in both hematopoietic cell lines and differentiated progenies of human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), where successful transcriptional activation of the coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) gene was confirmed. To investigate how higher activation efficiency could be attained, additional bioinformatic analyses, including a close inspection of the epigenetic landscape of differentiated erythroid cells and motif search within the FVIII locus, were conducted to further examine the in vitro experiment results and probe the transcriptional regulation of the targeted region. Notably, this approach holds promise for enabling effective hematopoietic cell therapy for a wide range of blood disorders as it circumvents problems faced by conventional gene therapies such as pre-existing adeno-associated viral immunity and the formation of inhibitory antibodies in patient subpopulations.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iVyHp-2v-nNw1s3Bmj2pwKt_Q8NkvJm9/view,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zxg9Rftd2tqsCjTeWgib2OH9RuFN6Taf/view,,X.103,Abha Ahuja,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nUDByF2o1oG4oSOI1wdc9agQGTHbh8_B8-arJEJwXPg/edit

China has been the largest e-commerce market in the world with a transaction volume of 28.66 trillion Yuan in 2017 (4.3 trillion US dollars). The rapid growth rate and huge market size make China the most attractive e-commerce market in the world. However, Alibaba and JD.com control nearly 75% of the Chinese e-commerce market.

I’ve also started to convert the designs into actual code. I’ve built the backend and frontend of a web application that enables venues to browse for artists, with plans to do much more.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SwfGUFLSy9E7VqCrFxQFxHDUUsdkvTli/view,,,X.106,Trisha Stan,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nUDByF2o1oG4oSOI1wdc9agQGTHbh8_B8-arJEJwXPg/edit
Zhanchen,Guo,2019104,CS/B,N/A,Meta Decentralized Token Swapping Service,"development of a crytpocurrency wallet (could use a set of CS eyes on this one)

""Introduction to Blockchain and Decentralized Swapping""",,"For the past one and half year, I led my team to build a cryptocurrency wallet called DAO wallet under AiDAO project (AiDAO, 2017). The current phase of development of the wallet is to provide Decentralized Token Swapping Service (Abbreviated as DTSS) into the wallet, which means users can swap their existing digital assets to another inside our wallet. It automates the process where users manually sell their cryptocurrencies for another. It also makes use of on-chain smart contract rather than centralized exchange to guarantee users the control of their tokens as well as providing higher security standards. Considering the resource and time constraints, we chose a special type of DTSS direction: meta-DTSS (Abbreviated as m-DTSS or mDTSS) which integrates Decentralized Exchanges (Abbreviated as DEXs), and other DTSSs. In this paper, I will demonstrate the advantages and disadvantages of DEXs, DTSSs, and mDTSSs in both technical and business perspectives. I will also introduce the overarching technical approaches that I have done for implementing meta-DTSS as well as performing a thorough business analysis of its potentials. 
-------------------------------
 Digital Assets: In the context of this paper, it only refers to as cryptocurrencies. Mostly fungible digital coins, but it can also include non-fungible blockchain-based assets such as crypto-kitties.
 On-Chain: On-chain short for “on the blockchain”. It often refers to programs or transactions that are executed and recorded on the blockchain. Off-chain refers to programs or transactions happened not on the blockchain but on the private computers or servers.
 Smart Contract: Smart contract is the type of computer programs that can be run on top of the blockchain. Further details state in the following background section. All smart contracts are on-chain.
 Centralized Exchange: The word “Exchange” in this paper all refers to as cryptocurrency exchange including crypto-to-fiat and crypto-to-crypto conversion. Centralized exchange means the exchange applications are running on companies’ servers, which means the transactions will only be recorded on the companies’ servers rather than the blockchain.
 Token: Token can be referred to as any cryptocurrencies, however in a narrow sense it refers to the type of cryptocurrencies that exist on top of a 3-party blockchain. For example, Essentia is a token that exists on top of Ethereum blockchain. Essentia does not have blockchain of its own. Coin can be referred to as the type of cryptocurrencies that has its own blockchain such as Bitcoin and Litecoin.
 Decentralized exchanges: it refers to the exchanges that use smart contract to handle deposit/withdraw (if needed), place and execute orders on the blockchain. It represents a high level of security, anonymity and no possible for censorship.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sSksSNZ_QZJSzEkWzlKA6Qioap9O-Pjk/view,,,X.107,Christine Looser,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nUDByF2o1oG4oSOI1wdc9agQGTHbh8_B8-arJEJwXPg/edit
Zitong,Mao,2019105,CS/B,N/A,Designing and Building a Startup Simulation Game,"App-game that iterates on decision making for start-up businesses

""Designing and Building a Startup Simulation Game""",,"This project builds a bridge between business education and video games by designing and developing a novel web-based startup simulation game that is not only fun to play but also useful for learning entrepreneurial skills. After identifying the need for such games and a lack of existing products, various design principles are applied during the design process. Through several iterations, this game has transformed from a basic text-based game to a sophisticated probability-based startup simulation. The game is developed in Javascript and is currently available on all internet browsers. In the near future, when the server-side features are completed, this project will evolve past beyond the scope of gaming and education. It will revolutionize traditional data collection methods in areas including observational studies and marketing research.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lQt3bQ09GzKwgYLMWRgcMwQcua7Yw07Q/view,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fYoLF1Q-7RZcpw4mLwx6xbtYr8ssY_4T/view,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jKQcnZVkyyU20CicSdazacX3Su1BsKYH/view,X.108,Dollie Davis,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nUDByF2o1oG4oSOI1wdc9agQGTHbh8_B8-arJEJwXPg/edit
Zoey,Haar,2019106,AH,SS,Killing It: In-Depth Explanations of My Own Jokes and a Novel Conception of Humor for the Rest,"This project is a portfolio of creative works that each rely on humor as a tool. The genres of the pieces vary, including parody, listicle, script, and satirical news. An accompanying academic paper will analyze these pieces and further postulate on humor as a device in the construction of identity. Using theories of humor, the paper will explore how humor aids or enhances in self-characterization and the ways in which it is used to convey a relationship between how the speaker sees herself and the larger world.

""A Prospectus To End World Hunger and Save the Bees: On Humor Theory and Its Implications""",,"The paper and portfolio presented here explore the mechanisms and functions of humor. My portfolio is a collection of seven pieces of written satire which take various forms, including list, news satire, monologue, and more. Each piece uses different techniques of humor to comment on aspects of human nature, social discourse, or the feminine identity. The paper is a contextualizing body of academic research and theory that unites evidence from across disciplines to offer a novel conception of humor. The conception of humor presented here understands humor as a device for defining and communicating personal identity and affiliation. Through this lens, humor is considered a “play space” for new ideas that is becoming increasingly important in light of recent political and social polarization.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wlmMZyQ05BVYWtpJin5_A6z8bsWTRB2V/view,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_R-bL8Jghjqv0pWCaKfLnXjVvW1cK4F0/view,,X.109,Grace Woods-Puckett,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nUDByF2o1oG4oSOI1wdc9agQGTHbh8_B8-arJEJwXPg/edit
