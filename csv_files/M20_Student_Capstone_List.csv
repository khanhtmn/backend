Renowned authors like Korbel initially believed that Kashmir is a matter of pure nationalism for India and Pakistan. However, over time, other factors begin to surface as the conflict proceeded, these include a lack of flexibility by both nations and other such problems. My research reveals that the problem in Kashmir is vastly complex because of the stakes of the agents involved. However, it is imperative to pay attention to the division of water resources in Kashmir if a permanent solution to the problem is to be reached.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VG-ZXQTj8P8gqIoeWL1FxV0mqq2iFu8t/view,,,X.001,E.

They exist to mark the border between the known, categorical,

These unnatural, inhuman creatures are recognized by their defiance of any succinct
categorization biologically, morally, or emotionally. The monster has been a part of storytelling
practice since nearly the beginning of storytelling. Despite this, the term “monster” suffers from
an oxymoronic status of being a feature of human storytelling that is defined by its defiance of
definition. The most salient and comical example is wikipedia’s list of Vampires that include
Bram Stoker’s Dracula, Chocula, Nosferatu, and Bunnicula. As such, the academic field of 1

Sherington Anton,Amarapala,2020003,BZ/SS,N/A,A Case Study on Lean Startup in a Multinational Edtech Startup,Qualitative Research Methodologies & Build-Measure-Learn,"Lean thinking is a frequently used methodology for companies of all sizes that aims to shorten the product development process, reducing manufacturing and development costs, and assessing the feasibility of a business model and product. Extensive literature exists on the application of lean thinking in startups, commonly referred to as lean startup. However, few papers consider the applications and benefits of lean startup on software and product development in multinational small and medium-sized enterprises (SME).

This paper presents a case study on the implementation of the lean startup methodology in a multinational educational technology startup, with a remote workforce, within the chess industry, from the perspective of a participant-observer. The study considers the five principles of lean startup; Entrepreneurs are everywhere, Entrepreneurship is management, Validated Learning, Build–Measure–Learn, and Innovation Accounting; in the setting of a multinational startup. The author applied three qualitative research methodologies; participant-observer, semi-structured interviews, and workshops, to observe the application of lean startup at The Play Magnus Group of Companies. Application of lean startup in a company with a distributed workforce poses big challenges such as the lack of oversight, communication issues, and misaligned incentives. This case study recommends modifying the lean startup principles to include frameworks for resource allocation and validated-learning retention, in addition to ensuring company wide alignment to better implement lean startup in a multinational context with remotely collaborating teams.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-rCxMEQXWFqnSDkmBr501P5jfpyd2iu_/view,,,X.003,A.

Dana (Pax),Bakke,2020004,NS/SS,N/A,Decomposers & Disturbances: A review of microbial community response to disturbance in El Yunque National Forest,Decomposers and Disturbances: Understanding microbial community response to hurricanes in El Yunque National Forest,"Climate change has increasingly complex effects on ecosystems, and anthropogenic alterations of temperature and atmospheric chemistry are disrupting natural disturbance regimes. Currently, there is a limit to scientific knowledge of how changing disturbance regimes might impact microbial communities. This literature review seeks to characterize how hurricanes specifically impact the structure and function of microbial decomposer communities found in leaf litter in the Luquillo Experimental Forest in Puerto Rico. Hurricanes disrupt tropical rainforests by defoliating trees and opening the canopy, which affects microbial communities in leaf litter on the forest floor. These microbes play a significant role in the health of tropical rainforest ecosystems through the decomposition of organic matter, removal of waste, and cycling of nutrients. Understanding how the increased intensity of hurricanes might impact the function of microbial communities is crucial, as their degradation can decrease the ability of an ecosystem to return to pre-disturbance equilibriums. Research from the Luquillo Experimental Forest, a tropical rainforest site in Puerto Rico, suggests that microbial community composition will change in response to increased intensity of hurricanes. Many microbial species are less tolerant of the heat, light, and decreased leaf litter moisture that accompanies canopy opening, and unable to decompose the fresh debris deposited during a forest floor. These species will be less successful in a disturbance regime with more intense hurricanes. Therefore, research focused on describing microbial species and their functions, as well as experimentally simulating disturbances to monitor how microbial communities recover from disturbance in both structure and function, will be crucial, as the health of tropical rainforest ecosystems relies on the future of its microbial communities.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tZ13PnUO2UXQ-XZpISfzZTQKWBcN1irc/view,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g1UbJ638aQdwQrJISojOG9Sdo1Z0r54i/view,,X.004,S.

Fast fashion companies in developed countries are increasingly relying on manufacturers in the developing world, such as in Bangladesh, Vietnam and Ethiopia, to outsource their production in order to reduce the costs of their supply chain. Due to the encouragement of foreign direct investment (FDI) in these countries in order to boost their economy, outsourced manufacturing costs are low, while ownership and economic value of the final garment remains with the fashion brand. Furthermore, by competing with one another for FDI, the developing countries continue to reduce taxation costs, harming the national social welfare. This paper proposes the use of technological innovation, such as a machine learning algorithm which produces fashion designs, to bring the consumer closer to the manufacturer, reducing the dependency on the fashion brands from developed countries, and increasing the ownership and value of the fashion object from the manufacturing source.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/18c4wQ6qAEIVNUqORFBnx3Lwdu2DTa1b_/view,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SPZpuR43zLW5A6IlCWKYWjzakbE2q9tu/view,,X.006,P.

Mariah,Bouthiller,2020008,NS/AH,N/A,Reeling in the Anchor on Climate Change Scepticism,Structures and Dynamics of Engagement with Misinformation: Climate Change Scepticism in the United States,"Climate change scepticism and denial has become pervasive in the American media and political sphere. This phenomenon is prominent in conservative communities and emergent from a rich tapestry of historical roots in anti-communism and scientific politicisation that has cultivated distrust and misunderstanding between the public and scientists. Fundamental misconceptions on the nature of uncertainty in science, the trustworthiness of the peer review process, and the accuracy of climate models, among other things, provide pertinent speed bumps for public support on climate mitigation legislation. If we wish to make progress to counter this bias, we must disprove the underlying misconceptions with a strategy both rich in evidence and free of condescension. This goal can be addressed through the contextualization of different aspects of the problem within their historical context and the subsequent reframing of the phenomenon of climate scepticism as a whole. This project provides the historical context, through temporal context, case studies of the prominent financing agents ExxonMobil and the Koch Brothers, and case studies of the agents and organisations which serve as the face of the movement. This project, additionally, targets an audience already open to considering scientific information and climate change policy.

Joshua,Broomberg,2020009,CS,N/A,Hybrid Monte Carlo Benchmarks for Methods of Causal Inference,DANCING IN THE DARK: DETERMINING THE QUALITY OF CAUSAL INFERENCE METHODS WITHOUT ACCESS TO GROUND TRUTH,"The last decade has seen enormous progress in the development of methods that ex-tract predictive information from growing stores of observational data. There has also been progress in the development of methods for causal inference - inference aimed at extracting the effect of interventions from observational data. But progress in the research and adoption of causal inference methods has been hindered by the difficulty of reliable performance evaluation (benchmarking). Unlike in predictive inference, one cannot simply construct ‘training’ and ‘test’ data by partitioning an available IID  dataset. Further, methods of causal inference are often intentionally applied in distributional settings different to the ones in which they are developed, placing a greater emphasis on generalization. 

Different solutions to this evaluation problem yield benchmarking approaches that make different trade-offs between the specific validity of evaluation in one, typically empirical distributional setting and the general validity of evaluation across multiple, typically synthetic distributional settings. This paper proposes a theoretical frame-work that formalizes this trade-off and then applies it to review the approaches that appear in the literature. Hybrid Monte Carlo benchmarking, which blends empirical covariate data and synthetic treatment and outcome mechanisms, is identified as an approach that makes a near-optimal validity trade-off. Based on this insight, this paper presents a benchmarking design and implementation, inspired by the variant of hybrid Monte Carlo proposed in Dorie, Hill, Shalit, Scott, and Cervone (2019), that generates benchmark data by sampling from a parameterized distribution over data generating processes defined over empirical covariates. This enables the evaluation of causal inference methods across the distributional problem space while preserving the specific validity of the evaluation in each setting. An validation study, based on the accompanying implementation, provides initial evidence of the relative superiority of the approach.

In this context, this study analyzes the role of Pronatec in fostering regional economic development by increasing per capita income, youth employment rates, and high school graduation rates, and decreasing income inequality. Using publicly available government data, I exploit the variation created by Pronatec’s “Professionalized Brazil” initiative, that began in 2008, to estimate the causal effect of receiving the program at the municipality level. The results point to a positive and significant, but economically negligible, effect of technical education on municipal development outcomes. Municipalities that seem to benefit most from technical education are those with medium degrees of economic development, from a GDP per capita and income inequality perspective, but low rates of youth employment and high school graduation. Despite the small impact at the municipal level, technical education does seem to bring benefits to Brazil’s GDP growth overall, and is worthwhile from a cost-benefit perspective.

This is largely due to the fact that the global fashion production system was never designed to be environmentally sustainable; it was designed to be efficient and profitable. However, as the climate crisis begins to threatens the lives of millions (Dunne, 2018), the world is realizing that change in fashion is imperative. As the three major stakeholders of the fashion industry (consumers, governments, and businesses) are all moving towards environmental sustainability, fast fashion companies are being forced to respond. H&M is one company that has acted swiftly and have received widespread recognition for their commitments towards environmental sustainability. Forever 21, on the other hand, stand as an example of a company that has failed to respond effectively. Aside from neglecting to adapting to the market shift towards environmental sustainability, their poor e-commerce and ambitious real estate strategy lost them three out of four core strengths, eventually leading to bankruptcy. Luckily, bankruptcy does not mean the end for the fast-fashion pioneer. By taking the steps outlined in the proposal to implement a business strategy surrounding social and environmental responsibility, the company can regain the relevance among youths that used to be one of their main strengths.

Abigail,Cox,2020014,SS,AH,Rights to Healthcare in the United States: An Analysis of the Affordable Care Act’s Improvements on Health Outcomes,An Analysis of the Affordable Care Act’s Improvements on Health Outcomes,"Health is a human right. There is a human right to health and healthcare, healthcare is an enforceable human right, and therefore should be enforced by the United States. When healthcare is enforced, the public is healthier and can more easily and more readily contribute to the nation’s economy and functioning society. Healthcare was not always enforced in the United States, particularly prior to 1950 due to racial biases, fear of communism, and general economic conservatism. Consequently, many went uninsured, did not receive annual checkups or routine care, and preventative services. This lack of an insured population, as well as a large underinsured population led to the creation of the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act’s implementation was the most comprehensive health insurance plan to date in the country, a seeming reversal of the ineffective healthcare policies that were active at the time. To assess whether or not the ACA has been beneficial, I have analyzed the philosophical arguments for enforcing healthcare, examined the historical implications of the multi-payer healthcare system of the United States, and looked at provisions of the ACA in relation to health outcomes to determine effectiveness of the current system. Using various measures of government application of the Affordable Care Act, particularly qualitative policy analysis and analyzing the government’s ability to improve health outcomes through policy, I find that improved access to healthcare, in combination with more affordable healthcare has had a positive effect on health outcomes, specifically on lower income individuals- largely Medicaid recipients. Healthcare is an enforceable right, and when enforced, it provides improved health outcomes of insurance recipients. My conclusions support the United States continuing to enforce healthcare in the form of the Affordable Care Act, with the most beneficial results coming from all states expanding healthcare.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/16WttPtRwvx8tvij9HalVzjcGePvEVRbq/view,,,X.015,E.

Duy Nguyen,Dang,2020016,BZ,N/A,SUSTAINABILITY OF THE LUXURY FASHION INDUSTRY,SUSTAINABILITY OF THE LUXURY FASHION INDUSTRY,"SUSTAINABILITY OF THE LUXURY FASHION INDUSTRY

This paper, “Sustainability of the Luxury Fashion Industry” will discuss one of our century’s most crucial problems - the sustainability of businesses, especially in the luxury fashion industry. Despite the availability of general guidelines in the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) reports, luxury fashion enterprises have their distinct approaches, missions, or strategies when it comes to measuring and tracking sustainability. By going through the following three points of view, this article will give readers a more comprehensive view of Sustainability of the Luxury Fashion Industry:

1. Building the crossroad at sustainability report from data analysis of multiple big players’ reports - big luxury fashion industry.
2. Set sustainability as a long-term goal and one of the main strategies, then define how it is different from other industries.
3. Identify initiatives in a circular economy, then clarify the correlation between sustainability initiatives and financial growth.

This paper explores five key long-term growth initiatives: (i) A sustainable supply of raw materials, (ii) Localized market penetration plan, (iii) Improvement in strategy and execution, (iv) Ethical initiatives, and (v) Internal sustainable goals. These initiatives have been mentioned in almost all luxury brand reports including Moët Hennessy – Louis Vuitton (LVMH), The Kering Group, Burberry Group PLC. And these initiatives are considered to be the key objectives for long-term strategic goals for the luxury fashion industry. 

With these key lessons, the sustainability model is suggested:

Competitive Advantage = fn(Sustainable supply of raw materials, Localized market penetration plan, Improvement in the strategy & execution, Ethical initiative,
Internal sustainable goal).

I hypothesize that this would help businesses and companies, especially players in the luxury fashion industry, gain competitive advantages to achieve success both financially and non-financially, especially in current competitive environment, through the optimization of cost and risk management, branding perception, and compliance/regulation. Here is Infographic and summarization for 5 key long-term growth initiatives, which are identified as competitive advantages, brands have to recognize.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/19LWZK4MqqHySzKV3-sVo-PMGea73ztMQ/view,,,X.017,E.

Only until recently did international conventions on conflict mention the inclusion of women in peace negotiations, peacekeeping, and national decision-making institutions. Nevertheless, women’s participation in post-conflict recovery has been empirically proven to (1) increase the effectiveness of commissions responsible for drafting a new constitution (Paffenholz et al., 2016), (2) enhance the provision of services such as clean water and education, which are crucial to stability (Chattopadhyay and Duflo, 2004), and (3) ease social tensions by bridging differences between various ethnic, religious, and political groups (Bloomfield et al., 2003). Moreover, research supports that countries with higher levels of gender equality have a lower tendency of internal conflict (Fearon, 2011). The impact of women’s political inclusion is limited by the theory of critical mass, which argues that there must be a sufficient number of women in order for them to have significant change and impact within a government body. To explore the different ways in which post-conflict countries can increase women’s political participation, I will be analyzing programs and policies implemented in Sierra Leone, Rwanda, and Liberia. This analysis yields a compilation of policy recommendations that can ideally be applied to improve women’s political representation in Libya.

Precious,Enahoro,2020020,BZ/CS,N/A,The benefits of improved demand forecasting: a case study,The benefits of improved demand forecasting: a case study,"Two of the largest South African supermarkets — Shoprite and Pick n Pay — use Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems for demand forecasting but these models are sub-par as they have led to high overstock, understock, wastage and reduced customer satisfaction in the country’s supermarket industry. To combat this, enhanced demand forecasting methods that allow for the inclusion of relevant demand-influencing variables that would make the forecasts more robust and accurate are needed in the industry. This is especially important, given an in-depth analysis of the South African supermarket industry that showed the adverse
effect of the country's economy on the industry’s growth, high bargaining power of customers and stiff rivalry among the biggest supermarkets in the industry.

In this project, two algorithms, Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing and Prophet were implemented using Walmart demand data as a proxy for South African supermarket data, with the hypothesis that Prophet would perform better, given that it allows for the inclusion of relevant exogenous variables to make the forecast. Cost of Forecast Error (CFE) and Mean Average Error (MAE) were used to evaluate the models. Prophet outperformed Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing as hypothesized, saving the supermarket $64,060 in costs using the CFE and an MAE of 89, which is about half that of the Holt-Winters model.

In this capstone, I go through the process of discovering patterns in financial transactions to help Charlie Finance, the company sponsoring my work, personalize its user experience. I begin by showing an effective way to encode people’s spending behaviors using their transactions into an embedding space. To study the patterns behind this data, I combine these embeddings with engineered features that communicate additional aspects about an individual’s financial health. In this joined vector space, I perform cluster analysis in search of a meaningful grouping of people based on their overall financial standing. Due to the lack of ground truth, the evaluation of the meaning behind the clusters is subjective to the goals of Charlie Finance.

Its fundamental and complex meaning from the biological and scientific contexts in which it was created is lost in its translation to practical, everyday action (Sneddon, 2006). If society continues to accept a varying and vague understanding of sustainability –– one that ignores the requirement of practical action, of changed approaches, and meaningful commitments –– we will succumb to climate catastrophe.

The Interactive Consciousness Model (ICM) is a deconstructive philosophical framework that extends the distinction between primary and secondary qualities of objects and is a helpful device to make some observations about Subjectivity.

Later on, this project presents a model, the Priming Competition Field model (PCF), that explains the positive and negative priming effects at Marr's second level of analysis. It begins not by asking how subjectivity emerges but rather how it participates in the causal mediums of reality. It claims that priming can be explained only by stimuli and memory. In order to do so, it idealizes memory using three postulates that loosely model the mechanics of memory, qualia and stimuli. Besides form predicting priming, the model predicts blockages of priming under certain circumstances.

This project is an exploratory data analysis of 86 hours of current EEG data collected from a CLIS (completely locked-in state) ALS patient. The analysis aims to extract cognitive activity in different frequency bands and observing their change over time. The goal of this is to identify cognitive measures that are stable enough to facilitate the identification of ”high interest/high alertness” periods during which BCI communication with the patient is more likely to succeed. 

The analysis suggests that the Dreem headset provides sufficient data quality for long-term recordings (little low-frequency noise and limited artifacts). We were able to identify two distinct frequency bands in the 1-2.5Hz and 2.5-4.5Hz ranges. Analysis results suggest a significant, positive correlation between this “alpha” and “theta” activation despite outlier and total power corrections.

Elisa,Heinrich,2020031,CS,N/A,Effects of network structural features on urban outputs,How human networks affect Cities,"More than half of the global population is currently urbanized. While this rapid urbanization expansion may boost economic growth, it also negatively affects the ability of cities to keep up with the demands of the growing population, affecting the access to opportunities, infrastructure, and basic services. While urban areas generate more than 75% of global GDP, they also include over 863 million urban dwellers living in slums and informal settlements. Empirical studies demonstrated that, when cities scale, lowest incomes grow just linearly or sub linearly, while highest income grow super linearly. Thus, even when cities get richer when scaling up, income deciles scale differently. This thesis explores empirical heterogeneity within Urban Scaling by characterizing income distributions across US Metropolitan Areas, demonstrating the Matthew Effect across cities of increasing size. We suspect that this behavior is caused by a topological transition of human networks in urban settings, resulting in fractal structures, which precludes the normal flow of information, including economic benefits. Using our empirical model as an comparative analysis, we aim to identify the effect of the structural features in interactive urban networks on the scaling outputs, in order to demonstrate how the topological structure impacts the distribution of economic benefits.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y2wrmAsi2Hla2oOYBDhTAJCjZSmMVzi5/view,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZL6iLw1OsS_SB_yOFXRGL182a1eybHJc/view,,X.033,R.

We solve this problem by using machine learning to create a classification model that will more accurately categorize mobile games using the name of the game and the description of the games provided by the game developers on the different mobile application stores. We show that by using a combination of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) as the encoder-decoder system and the Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm (LDA) as the classification model, we are able to categorize games with more accuracy or just as accurately as the categorizations used in the Google Playstore and the Apple App Store and provide mobile developers and other stakeholders with a computationally efficient and reliable method for classifying games that is independent of the two dominant application store categorization methods.

Modeling Complex Systems - The Case of Abnormal Predictive Coding,"Recent advances in computational modeling, genome-wide association studies, neuroimaging, and theoretical neuroscience pose better opportunities to study neurocognitive disorders, such as schizophrenia (Krystal et al., 2017). However, despite a  repeated examination of its well-characterized phenotypes, our understanding of the disorder’s neurophysiological biomarkers or cortical dynamics remain elusive. This study poses a biophysical spiking neuron model of perceptual inference, based on the predictive coding framework. The model, implemented through NetPyNE (and NEURON (Carnevale et al., 2006)), mimics the circuits of the auditory cortex. This model allows for the exploration of the effects that biogenetic variants have on auditory mismatch negativity (MMN) deficits, a suggested biomarker for schizophrenia (Garrido et al., 2009b). More specifically, the model distinguishes between repetition suppression and prediction error and examines their respective contribution to the MMN.

First, this paper establishes the model’s explanatory power using two commonly used paradigms: the oddball and the cascade paradigm. Both are able to reproduce the electrophysiological measures of MMN among healthy subjects. Second, via tuning the parameters of single-neuron equations or the network’s synaptic weights, the model exhibits LFP variants associated with schizophrenia (Michie et al., 2016). Therefore, this model enables exploring how biogenetic irregularities associated with neurocognitive disorders (e.g., schizophrenia) affect the underlying components of the observed MMN deficits. Novel, yet preliminary, predictions are presented, and future steps for validation are suggested.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1seEY1Zcx_a3GRyVfYSqBjY21g6U22m78/view,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xy_Bo3mR0NBUaNYpFT0JqQ7TwHykv9P-/view,x1,X.042,J.

KangSan (Antonio Stark),Kim,2020044,BZ/CS,N/A,CP194 Final Deliverable,No Title,"The term “NewSpace” is widely used to refer to the aerospace ecosystem that came into existence in the 21st century. NewSpace is characterized by a broad set of new regulatory infrastructure, financial incentives, and actors. The environment is rapidly growing in terms of size and diversity, and NewSpace market entities have a variety of methods in which to get finances. This paper describes the three major types of acquiring finances in the NewSpace market and the two market trends that have emerged in the last decades. The paper concludes that NewSpace firms that best align strategic growth vision with local markets have the best chances of acquiring effective finances. 

The three sources of finances are government, private investments, and public investments. For the U.S. and “coordinator governments,” contracts and dedicated funds exist in most service sectors, with established regulatory bodies providing predictability and accuracy in long-term financial planning. For supporter governments, it is recommended to identify the stability and focus of government agendas, as support is limited and long-term planning can be hindered by political forces. Private investments come in venture capital investments or corporate investments, with the former growing in popularity and investment size, while the latter often provides strategic and technological guidance. Financing through public stock exchanges is decreasing in popularity but remains as a strategic tool for firms looking for liquidity and scaling into new markets. Crowdfunding is both a low-barrier financing point for new entrants as well as marketing strategies for firms that value community awareness.

The two market trends are internationalization and diversification. Internationalization is exhibited in the supply chain of the NewSpace market, with new actors being involved through strategic importance, low-cost supply, and high-end supply. Certain geographies pose strategic advantages due to their proximity to other nations, or its near-equatorial latitudes, or for regional military security, where space access is of strategic importance. Involvement by low-cost supply is provided by supplying cheaper, higher-risk components in the global supply chain. Involvement by high-end supply is by establishing a legal or financial infrastructure that is unavailable in other countries. Diversification is represented in supply, demand, and the market. Diversification of supply has been facilitated by increased standardization efforts, while demand has been triggered by increased political stability from outsourcing the value chain. Private markets have diversified from launches and satellites to management and operational sectors.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_cchVkwJnSSAm7K4xBxOC2sq-bvEmL_D/view,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qFvMktvmPrjWmLsHCM1TExDfyf5V4UXb/view,,X.046,A.

Some methodologies, such as those utilized in the business discipline, tend to focus on an active learning environment that encourages participation. On the other hand, art history classes frequently utilize lectures to convey information. In researching pedagogical best practices, there is an issue with how students participate in arts classes, engage with the information, and how much of the information they retain in the long run. One method that many business classes use is the case study approach, where the material is conveyed through story-like engaging narratives. While the way professors use case studies could differ, the research behind this project showcases that professors have reported higher engagement and participation rates during class as well as prolonged information retention. This project shows that case studies are useful learning and teaching tools for the art history field based on the evaluation of various advantages and disadvantages of case studies versus a more traditional learning approach, lectures. To sum up the research, the product portion of this project showcases an example of how case studies can be used within the art history field, using some of the most successful features highlighted during research.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1w04IB32LUwFvO31UiGEOvBY4Y0roXjo2/view,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YF4cN3yBnQ-J9XBtwgCmva2jXs7gYsL6/view,,X.047,C.

Exposure to greenery is associated with a plethora of benefits, from reduced mortality and instances of mental illness, to increases in neighborhood social cohesion and network ties, and decreased criminal activity. It is an environmental injustice, then, that in US cities, poor and minority residents have significantly less access to vegetation in their day-to-day lives.

This report reviews the following: the current literature on the impacts of greenery at multiple levels of analysis; the distribution of access from an environmental justice perspective; the research on the displacement side-effects of greening initiatives; and the literature on how to create more equitable greening programs. The report finds a gap in research on how planners themselves can contribute to the amelioration of this issue.

This can be mainly attributed to experimental design flaws, such as too small sample sizes, especially for positive cases, mixed data acquisition methods with unclear pre-processing steps, and omission of controversial cases, leading to non-generalizable and non-reproducible results. In this paper, we quantify and compare human evaluation methods for thermography interpretation available in the literature. We also demonstrate that modern feature engineering and data augmentation techniques, combined with a sufficient number of samples, help to overcome the problem of the imbalanced dataset and prove that thermography can be used as a reliable method for breast cancer screening and lead to much earlier detection, improving cancer patient survival.

Eric,Lin,2020052,BZ,AH,Social Housing A Look at Singapore and the United States,Social Housing: A Look at Singapore and the United States,"A comparative analysis between the public housing program led by the Housing Development Board in Singapore and two housing subsidies in the US: the Low Income Housing Tax Credit and Department of Housing and Urban Development Housing Choice Vouchers. The paper looks at the benefits and drawbacks of both countries’ programs then synthesize what the American programs can and cannot learn from Singapore. Analysis considers how the two programs can improve and learn from Singapore, despite the two countries being very differently run governmentally. Singapore’s housing program ensures its goals are met, housing a large majority of the country’s population. It has innovative implementation design, a committed government participation, and a system that makes money, which reduces costs. That is not to say Singapore is without issue. Its systems are beginning to show signs of aging. And worse, its government form could turn tyrannical under poor management. In the US housing is a way to correct for inequalities. There is very good evidence to show that safe and comfortable housing can provide those with less privilege the opportunity to climb the social ladder. The Housing Choice Voucher does a lot of good ensuring those who need help getting housing, have a safe and comfortable place to be. It, however, greatly lacks in funding and requires large administrative redesign. Taking from Singapore’s HDB, the benefits of centralization can be transferred to the US in a less paternalistic form of policy making. The Low Income Housing Tax Credit, is a smart way to direct business towards benefiting the worst off in society. However, because of the complex bureaucracy and poor information management it is prone to corruption. There are potential steps the tax credit can take to lower its risk of corruption and increase its efficiency but these are largely quantitatively unsubstantiated, requiring more research to confirm causal mechanisms.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q3krd4h-7r-UjjO4tgjwRvYtDHE423zZ/view,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K2XWUJNgmzc6gOCjtGXk-Dsi_4MmNtFG/view,,X.054,W.

Yihan (Valentina),Liu,2020053,SS,AH,How authoritarian regimes survive? A Case Study of China,How authoritarian regimes survive?  A Case Study of China,"Many scholars, such as the likes of Francis Fukuyama, have argued for decades that economic development and free markets are a precursor to democratic political systems. China, an authoritarian regime, has not followed this pattern. This paper seeks to answer the question ""How authoritarian regimes survive?"" By using China as a case study and using historical institutionalism as the guiding methodology, this paper investigates the historical evidence around the time of China's market reform. This paper concludes that the survival of authoritarian regimes is a matter of legitimacy. Before the reform, China relied on communist legitimacy. The tragic failure of Mao's central planning policies debilitated the basis for communist legitimacy, and Deng embarked on the reform to harness economic legitimacy instead. However, the Tiananmen Square Protest proved that economic legitimacy alone was not sufficient at legitimizing the regime, which was why the Party decided to introduce nationalist legitimacy. This paper suggests that an authoritarian regime that can secure non-democratic sources of legitimacy does not necessarily have to democratize. The implication for modern authoritarian regimes is that they need to pay special attention to people's perception of their legitimacy and be ready to adapt their institutions to diversify and strengthen their legitimacy when necessary.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RajqvwvkDaaRJZvneZu1B9iyFoYFsoES/view,,,X.055,T.

The methods that are applied are Multiples, Precedent Transaction, Leveraged Buyout and Discounted Cash Flow (DCF). Additionally, DuPont Analysis, the 4P Framework and a SWOT analysis is applied to derive cash flow predictions for the DCF. Tesla is growing at an exponential rate in a rapidly changing market with no clear comparables, and therefore the paper makes the argument that the DCF currently provides a more appropriate valuation range for the company.

This is largely due to the reliance on conventional, genre-specific elements that help to set and fulfill audience expectations. In this Capstone project, a conditional deep convolutional generative adversarial network (cDCGAN) was trained on a dataset of artwork labelled by film genres scraped from ArtStation. The genre labels were embedded into the training images (via concatenation at the final linear layer of the network) to encourage the model to learn the visual differences between different genres and subsequently generate genre-specific artwork. A qualitative inspection of the results revealed generated images with high-contrast color schemes among all the classes, with face-like images appearing in selected images from the cartoon and western classes. The noir class, which had less training images compared to the others, experienced a degeneration in image quality as training progressed, suggesting that the dataset size contributes significantly to the quality of the generated images. Overall, the research results suggest that the curation of a larger dataset with careful pruning of disruptive images, i.e. images that grossly defy the visual conventions of their genre labels, could significantly improve the quality of generated images.

At the same time, Rossmann’s competitors have enjoyed higher rates of store turnover. To grow store turnover, a Retail Transformation Plan is proposed with three main pillars: Tactical Promotions, Data Analytics, and The Perfect Store. We have shown significant opportunities to make promotions more targeted, such as running promotions 9 days before a state holiday to improve store turnovers. Furthermore, investments in data analytics is a key next-step to ensure transformation success. We have proposed a data-driven segmentation methodology to study store declines based on geographic and localized socioeconomic data points to grow store sales. Finally, this plan outlines how Rossmann can improve in-store execution through the Perfect Store methodology and drive an increase in average order value. Piecing these qualitative and quantitative studies together, these recommendations can result in a 7% sales growth opportunity, or €226 million in new revenues, for Rossmann in 2016.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Vu1FlCbkKR62DQLqNqKJD5R8wQx8Sfg1/view,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xi39L1NOZKpebFB7eoN9Tl2G46hj17xb/view,x1,X.058,N.

They ensure transactions between different stakeholders and enable business activity to be carried out.

Wealthy households continue to enjoy their lives through robust financial systems that enable continuous economic activity at ease for these individuals. However, currently, about 2.5 Billion people in the world - mostly poor - are not part of this system and hence are at a significant disadvantage in terms of their prospects regarding economic prosperity. Within Pakistan, the case study for this paper, only 9% of the population own a bank account.

However, the government of Pakistan is working towards documenting the economy, improving the financial inclusion within the country, and providing financial and operational support to technology companies to establish within Pakistan to help with these tasks. Hence, this paper is divided into two major sections.

Vinicius,Miranda,2020068,CS,N/A,A Critical Evaluation of Hate Speech Classifiers,A Critical Evaluation of Hate Speech Classifiers,"In recent years, the spread of hate speech has attracted the attention of academia, governments, and industry alike in response to its dire consequences, online and otherwise. For example, the United Nations Human Rights Council (2018) implicated social media platforms in contributing to the genocide in Myanmar by allowing the systematic dissemination of hatred against Rohingya Muslims. The sheer scale of the generation of online content motivates the necessity of automatic moderation mechanisms, such as the classification and removal of hate speech. The first achievement of this research project is to provide a critical evaluation of the state of the art of the hate speech classification literature by replicating and analysis of three prominent papers. The second contribution is to provide the blueprint of a generalizable training strategy for a hate speech classifier that incorporates transfer learning strategies in Natural Language Processing (NLP).

Connor,Mitchell,2020069,CS,NS,Adaptable Geographic Clustering: A Data-Driven and Dynamic Market Expansion Technique for Home Installers,Adaptable Geographic Clustering: A Data-Driven and Dynamic Market Expansion Technique for Home Installers,"The proliferation of ecommerce across industries combined with affordable and efficient shipping options has removed many traditional barriers of entry to new geographical markets within a single country. However, industries with products that require on-site installation still struggle with managing serviceable territory, including whether to enter or leave new markets. While demand density is often the most heavily-weighted variable in the market expansion decision, there are many others including “soft” operational costs that home-installation businesses need to account for. Traditional accounting and financial models are capable of handling the comparison, but often require the input of assumptions that restrict the domain of possible options. This is analogous to identifying a local maximum for a market’s value.

This paper accomplishes three goals:

1. Discusses the need for more flexible and adaptable market expansion frameworks
2. Explores the potential effect of changing one of these assumptions (the geographical definition of a market) on new market potential
3. Provides a machine learning-based tool to implement this approach with a built-in cost model.

The tool described in the third goal performs geographic clustering of out-of-territory leads into optimally dense groups within a certain mile radius, then produces
installation-level cost estimates given a customizable cost model input. While built in Python, it is designed for non-technical operations managers and training materials are provided.

Ngoc Minh Tu (Ash),Nguyen,2020079,CS,N/A,Classification & Generation Of Human Pose Sequences,Classification & Generation Of Human Pose Sequences,"The capstone project investigates the effect of projecting a human pose dataset into a different space on the peformances of neural networks via the two tasks of classification and generation. The problem here is interesting from both the theoretical and the practical perspective: modeling complex sequences are something researchers wish to do, and modeling human pose sequences can be applied into many possible products. Classically, some machine learning methods implicitly or explicitly transform the original dataset into a space with a different dimension (i.e. embedding), sometimes even infinite-dimensional space, such as Support Vector Machiness, and this transformation, when applied before classification or regression, yields performance gains. This paper explores the usage of variational autoencoders  (VAEs) in this embedding process on a complex dataset, namely human activity poses, and how this embedding changes the performance in the task of sequence modeling, such as classification of activity from poses and generation of probable subsequent poses. The hypothesis is that neural networks can learn complex dynamics of the human pose sequences. Using recurrent neural networks architectures, the results include an increase in accuracy in the classification task if we use the embedding instead of the original data (up to 7% increase in accuracy, with respect to the original data), although there is a notion of optimal embedding dimension, after which performance ceases to improve, and an increase in prediction error on the generation task, potentially due to the compounding of errors in a system of neural networks. 

The results indicate that there can be significant performance increases if VAE embedding is used as a preprocessing step for sequence modeling, out-performing models that use the raw input. We can apply sequence modeling models in this paper to various classification and generation tasks, including human pose modeling, which is seen in many applications.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YTTNYCeKgum99VKJEXIonwTYIMMNg7QA/view,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1u8gGeVDJWTypqUXZhtmKM-A9QBRQPy8z/view,,X.081,P.

There are multiple methods deployed to evaluate the effectiveness of social impact projects, including the theory of change, outcome stars, social return on investment, among others. While these methods have their pros and cons, it is sometimes unclear what they are most effective in measuring. This paper seeks to create a framework - the CCASS framework (active participation, storytelling; comparability; standardization, robustness) to assess impact measurement methods and find the most effective one for small- and medium-sized social enterprises. The author argues that existing methods are not sufficient as standalone methods of social impact measurement, but rather are complementary to one another and should be used in combination with each other. By using the CCASS framework, social impact businesses and social enterprises alike can identify which impact measurement methods can enhance their measurement frameworks. The author recommends that they combine methods rather than relying on only one framework.

Lastly, the author chooses Vietnam as an example case study because the social enterprise sector here is representative of that in developing nations. Sapa O’Chau and KOTO are two social enterprises in North Vietnam with varying levels of impact reporting experiences. They have been chosen as case studies to illustrate the application of the CCASS criteria.

While the living standards have improved, cardiovascular diseases (CVD) have also emerged as the leading public health burden. Canna plants are widely grown in the Northern mountainous region of Vietnam, and traditionally used by the ethnic Dao people as a CVD treatment. Some supplements from this plant extract exist but no drugs are approved to date.

Methodologies: We used bio-guided fractionation to extract and purify Canna extracts. Extracts from Canna plants at various concentrations were tested on plasma samples collected from donors between the ages of 18-23 for antiplatelet and anticoagulant abilities. Data were analyzed using t-tests and ANOVA on Excel and R.

Results: We found that certain organic and aqueous extracts of Canna edulis and Canna generalis exhibit significant antiplatelet properties. This antiplatelet effect is also dose-dependent. On the other hand, PT and aPTT measures did not differ significantly from normal measurements. Extracts at concentrations tested do not show significant anticoagulant effects. It is unclear whether increasing concentration will exhibit anticoagulant effects.

Discussion: Canna edulis proved itself a promising drug candidate. More studies with higher power of analysis are needed to prove the same for Canna generalis. Future research should also isolate pure bioactive compounds and investigate mechanisms of actions before subjecting the extracts to pre-clinical trials and clinical trials. Overall, while there are various challenges to the drug development process, our lab is hopeful that we will soon make sure of the rich biodiversity of Vietnam and produce more plant-based drugs.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FG9LliGbzdOpCzR6twENvSjYxHiEkBum/view,,,X.084,T.

This study aims to test the effects of priming technology, a methodology abstracted from agricultural sciences, on accelerating germination timing for native species. Seed priming encompasses several variants and works to boost germination timing. Hydropriming, solid matrix priming, and chemopriming were tested on three species of grasses native to Colorado rangelands: E. elymoides, P. secunda, and S. Scoparium. Hydropriming treatments were effective in accelerating germination for P. secunda, while solid matrix priming was most effective in accelerating germination for E. elymoides and S. Scoparium. The effects of dry down duration following prime treatment were also investigated, finding no significant difference in treatment effect as the result of drying duration.

Promo fraud occurs when an individual signs up for a service with multiple accounts in order to benefit from a sign-up promotion, such as a discount, and is a financial loss to a business. First, the data is labeled using as much data about the customer as possible, including data from the future and features that would be too slow to compute in production. Then, a supervised classification model is trained on data that is available at production and the labels identified by the first model. The paper includes a discussion on features relevant for promo fraud detection and overcoming the challenges of an imbalanced and unlabeled dataset. The random forest model is able to improve upon the plain logistic regression model, increasing the F1 score for the fraud class with a threshold at 0.5 from 0.00 to 0.65, detecting 10 out of 21 fraud cases in the test set with no wrong classification.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S4ejtuq8UsOFyoNEaZ0HqzCwKI9DYJEc/view,https://drive.google.com/file/d/12mRg0bFDd-wOqHlJ9bdDY0zQOEyDKE4k/view,x1,X.089,R.

Finally, it analyzes whether these same structures might linger in present-day Colombia.

With the impact of climate change on human migration already visible and predicted to increase, there is an acute lack of research on climate migration to inform concrete policy measures. Evidence-based policy can be informed by rigorously designed experimental studies. Thus, this paper proposes a cluster randomized control trial to study the impact of a water desalination program in the Ganges Delta; the coastal lowlands between India and Bangladesh predicted to become a hotspot of climate migration over the next decades. The Ganges Delta suffers greatly from rising sea levels and subsequently rising water and soil salinity. Consistent with the most recent literature in the field, I propose a detailed plan for a water desalination program in the area, followed by a randomized experimental design. I document evidence consistent with my experimental design using heterogeneity analysis, linear regression, and power calculations.

After an in-depth analysis of the bilateral market participants and the market trends that followed Basel III regulation, I argue 1 that the initiative fails to capture the full spectrum of the financing activities, characteristic of the
segment. Specifically, it leaves out off-balance-sheet alternative financing, conducted through derivative contracts. Since the survey exclusively inquires about securities financing transactions (SFT), it omits economically equivalent derivative trades, documented under the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) Master Agreement. As there is anecdotal evidence of the shift from classic SFT towards off-balance-sheet financing, I argue that the survey should be extended to account for economically equivalent derivative exposure. Such an extension to the survey will allow the regulators to gain a more comprehensive view of the bilateral market segment, in order to prevent a liquidity drought as well as fire sales and repo runs which are the two biggest risks to the repo market.

Neuropathic pain is a disorder which affects a number of individuals, but its current treatment is limited to general opioids or antidepressants, which are not targeted specifically to the molecular mechanisms of neuropathic pain; I hypothesize that focusing on the mechanisms underlying neuropathic pain will result in better treatment. In understanding these mechanisms,
microglia have emerged as a critical component of the development and continued existence of neuropathic pain, and the P2X4, TLR4, P2X7, and CX3CR1 receptors are possible microglia targets for treatment development. Additionally, epigenetics is a logical target, as the active state of microglia after neuropathic pain is likely in part due to epigenetics, given the changes in cytokine expression and activation seen in neuropathic pain. Combining these two mechanisms, various literature reveals the importance of the intersection of microglia and epigenetics in neuropathic pain, demonstrating its possible role in treatment. Finally, a study looking at the possibility of miRNAs as treatment for targeting HDAC1 expression in microglia is put forth in Chapter V, suggesting a direction for this field of research that may reveal treatment options which target the mechanisms of neuropathic pain, not just the symptoms.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HiyGjJgeoarDiU_5MCppSOvFMxwZ69KH/view,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hOazpJqbCiWUMt0esvMpUmOHh85m2d-F/view,,X.097,T.

In this Capstone, we develop the theory of inverse probabilistic modeling and introduce a novel workflow designed specif-

The workflow harnesses neural density estimation to learn a global, surrogate approximation to the likelihood, which is used in conjunction with an existing sample-efficient likelihood-free inference method.

Surprisingly, not objective waiting time, but perceived waiting time, is a better predictor of customer satisfaction in services. People evaluate experiences based on the peak emotion experienced and the end emotion experienced. In most convenient lines, such as supermarkets and grocery stores, the end experience will be the same, because the customer will attain what they have been waiting for. Therefore, the end emotion should not have a big impact on why customers perceive waiting experiences differently. However, the relationship between positive and negative peak experiences and waiting time remains unknown. This raises the question: does a positive peak experience during a waiting period decrease the perceived waiting time and vice versa? This text is a proposal for an experiment aiming to test this relationship. The proposed experiment exposes three randomised groups to either a positive peak experience, negative peak experience, or a neutral experience, and tests the relationship to the subject's perceived waiting time.

Adrian,Stein,2020108,SS,N/A,"Ending the tragedy of the unmanaged commons: How reputation and identity support sustainable, community-based resource governance","Ending the tragedy of the unmanaged commons: How reputation and identity support sustainable, community-based resource governance","I propose a cognitive-behavioral framework of common-pool resource governance and test its predictions through an agent-based computational model. The framework rests on a eassessment of the underlying assumptions of previous work on common-pool resource governance through the lens of behavioral and experimental economics, social neuroscience, and cognitive and social psychology. From the literature, I am hypothesizing two pathways towards better cooperation: a reputation system with peer punishment networks, and a collective identity that fosters a sense of belonging. The reputation mechanism relies on reflected appraisals of other’s behavior, while the identity mechanism engages emotional appraisals of group belonging and commitment. Simulations of the cognitive-behavioral framework confirm three central hypotheses, which can inform future experimental fieldwork and policy. (1) The identity and reputation mechanism both increase cooperation, and their effects are additive – they sustain higher resource sustainability together than each mechanism in isolation. Ideal applicability depends on the resource context. (2) Because humans overestimate others’ cooperation, incomplete networks without full transparency better support cooperation than complete information. (3) Increased social interaction significantly increases identity-based cooperation and can replace reputation systems, but it has no effects when the mechanisms work in tandem. A caveat is that the model also shows an emergent negative effect: reputation- and identity-based resource governance leads to inequality in outcomes amongst community members.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IMj5eY9m167qfc-eikPCD7S52nLj4TX9/view,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KRDes9gNbEE00D0pjILfXRzIhqRz3oEr/view,,X.110,R.

Christine,Tan,2020109,SS,AH,The Role of Short-Term Facilitation in Working Memory,The Role of Short-Term Facilitation in Working Memory,"Working memory (WM) is a unique form of short-term memory for task-relevant information. Understanding its mechanism is crucial due to its role in high-level cognitive functions and neurological diseases. Currently, two opposing models have been proposed to explain the neural substrate of WM - the persistent neuronal activity (PNA) model and the synaptic model. The PNA model argues that WM is maintained through the persistent firing of neurons, while the synaptic model argues that WM requires short-term facilitation (STF), a form of short-term plasticity which strengthens synapses after repeated stimulation. While the PNA model is faced with contradictory findings, the synaptic model has not been tested in-vivo. To test the hypothesis that WM requires STF, I employed two approaches: behavioral analysis of mice lacking Synaptotagmin-7 (Syt7), the calcium sensor for facilitation, and computational modeling of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with and without STF. As the mice did not sufficiently learn the WM paradigm, I could not test the role of STF in WM in the behavioral experiment. However, findings from the RNN experiment support the synaptic model as RNNs without STF show significantly more WM impairment than networks with STF due to the inability to store information using STF. My findings also support the idea that relying on PNA is not a biologically feasible strategy for WM maintenance. An exploratory analysis suggests that the removal of STF may impair learning. This study highlights the need to further research into the behavioral implications of STF.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QBbx9FGE6RLaq_sLQbl3JuQl5TX0I2WS/view,,,X.111,R.

Jack,Topolewski,2020110,BZ,N/A,Bootstrapping From the Ground up The Acquisition and Efficient use of Resources via Bootstrapping Methods,Bootstrapping From the Ground up: The Acquisition and Efficient use of Resources via Bootstrapping Methods,"Entrepreneurs and businesses regularly are challenged with the resource constraint problem which necessitates that they must find creative means of acquiring resources and, once acquired, implement measures to use those resources efficiently. When traditional funding such as venture capital or private investment is not available, bootstrapping methods provide alternative solutions to the problem for entrepreneurs and businesses alike. Despite the wide applicability of bootstrapping methodology, there is a dearth of academic literature surrounding the topic and, as a result, is often overlooked or underemphasized in business courses. This Capstone defines bootstrapping as it applies to business, summarizes the existing academic literature on the topic, and proposes a matrix based on the existing academic findings to help business people identify and evaluate bootstrapping methods for their unique situations. A case study, which documents the author’s own experience building a business from the ground up, is provided as an example of how to successfully bootstrap a company. The matrix is then applied to the case study to specifically demonstrate several use cases of the matrix itself. The goals of this project are to provide a basic tool that encourages business people to pause and think critically about decisions in the context of bootstrapping and creating more capital-efficient businesses, and to make an argument that more academic research and a greater emphasis of the importance of bootstrapping is necessary for the academic business community.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZbX5XVbGQ6lyutye5mxdrGJhSW2u0sNj/view,,,X.112,C.

Gelana,Tostaeva,2020111,CS,N/A,Attention Assessments: a UFOV Case Study,Attention Assessments: a UFOV Case Study,"Neuropsychological assessments are the accepted way to detect age-related cognitive decline in different domains; in particular, the Useful Field of View ® test of visual processing speed, the UFOV ® , has been shown to reliably predict driving performance of older adults. Recent studies, however, have reported unexpected results: some trials suggest no differences in the test performance across age groups which contradicts earlier findings of age-related effects on driving. This paper explores why this may be happening by analyzing the UFOV ® test paradigm from three different perspectives: theoretical, algorithmical, and implementational. We first establish whether the UFOV paradigm was ever a fair assessment of visual processing speed by analyzing the foundational theoretical frameworks. We then investigate why it fails to continue to do so by focusing on the change the paradigm has seen from measuring the extent of the UFOV to its efficiency. Our analysis reveals inconsistencies both in the scoring algorithm used to assess performance and the hardware medium used to present the test. Given our analysis and the utility of the paradigm in screening at-risk drivers, we propose that a development of a new, more consistent version of a UFOV assessment should be pursued.

It will show that frameworks from cause prioritisation can effectively be adapted to the political context by changing measurements and adding categories that can be excluded in non-political contexts. Then, this framework will be applied to compare solutions to political polarisation, or the increase of ideological and emotional cleavages around political issues in both the public and the political elite. This paper will conclude that the most effective solution to political polarisation depends on context, but that increasing intergroup contact through citizens’ assemblies appears to be the most generally promising solution reviewed.

Standardization in this regard implies having all study material being displayed on one page, using common fonts whenever possible, on a single tab. Amalgam combines all resources under one web page composed of collapsible widgets. Standardization is, in fact, the inspiration behind the name of the software, Amalgam, which means a mixture or a blend (Definition of AMALGAM. (n.d.)). Amalgam notebooks are a mixture of resources in one place organized in a coherent and easy to follow manner by their creators. The ‘help guide’ aspect manifests in the similarity statistics. In the context of Minerva Schools, at least, readings come with a study guide. This is usually a shortlist of the expected outcomes of the class and concepts one is expected to understand when doing pre-class readings. In a lot of classes, however, main readings tend to be long and dense, making them hard to follow even with a study guide. Experts suggest that on average, it takes at least three passes, with the third pass alone taking up to 6 hours to read and understand an average 28-page research paper (HowtoReadPaper.pdf. (n.d.)).

Jennifer Jiayi,Yang,2020120,CS,N/A,Improving the Robustness of Neural Network on Road Segmentation via Stability Training,Improving the Robustness of Neural Network on Road Segmentation via Stability Training,"Deep neural networks are known to be non-robust against small perturbations, which means that imperceptible changes to the input may alter the model output arbitrarily (Szegedy et al., 2014). Zheng, Song, Leung, and Good-fellow (2016) demonstrated the effectiveness of the stability training method, which introduces an additional loss term that enforces consistency when the model faces two similar inputs in improving the robustness of neural networks under naturally occurring perturbations such as JPEG compression. This paper builds upon Zheng et al. (2016) by evaluating the effectiveness of stability training on segmentation under the specific context of road segmentation using satellite images. We find that stability training helps maintain the model performance as image quality worsens under the condition that the baseline model performance is satisfactory (dice coefficient > 0.6)1.
